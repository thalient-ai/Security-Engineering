Resilience Technique Name,Resilience Technique Definition,Purpose
Adaptive Response,Implement agile courses of action to manage risks.,"Inform courses of action with situational awareness and predictive analytics for increased agility.
All approaches can leverage virtualization and are compatible with zero trust architecture (ZTA) and cloud computing strategies. All approaches can also be"
Analytic Monitoring,Monitor and analyze a wide range of properties and behaviors on an ongoing basis and in a coordinated way.,Systems can accumulate vast amounts of monitoring or logging data. Use monitoring data strategically to inform defensive activities.
Contextual Awareness,Construct and maintain current representations of the posture of missions or business functions considering threat events and courses of action.,Maintain cyber situational awareness to support mission continuity.
Coordinated Protection,Ensure that protection mechanisms operate in a coordinated and effective manner.,Lack of coordination introduces fragility and creates exposures to threats.
Deception,"Mislead, confuse, hide critical assets from, or expose covertly tainted assets to the adversary.","Apply deception strategically, tactically, or both. Ensure that cyber risk governance and SOC operations allow for deception and maintain deception resources. Deception can support analysis and attribution of adversary TTPs, and the development of cyber t"
Diversity,"Use heterogeneity to minimize common mode failures, particularly threat events exploiting common vulnerabilities.","Enterprise systems often include some diversity incidentally, as a result of procurements by different programs or at different times. Poorly managed, this can be costly and create security risks; well managed, it can make an adversary’s job harder.
Due t"
Dynamic Positioning,Distribute and dynamically relocate functionality or system resources.,Use moving target defenses to make an adversary’s job harder.
Non-Persistence,Generate and retain resources as needed or for a limited time.,Reduce the attack surface in the temporal dimension
Privilege Restriction,Restrict privileges based on attributes of users and system elements as well as on environmental factors.,Apply existing capabilities more stringently
Realignment,Structure systems and resource uses to meet mission or business function needs, to reduce current and anticipated risks
Redundancy,Provide multiple protected instances of critical resources.,"Redundancy is integral to system resilience, but it must be managed carefully to avoid redundant vulnerabilities and an increased attack surface."
Segmentation,Define and separate system elements based on criticality and trustworthiness.,Reduce the adversary’s scope for lateral movement or command and control (C2).
Substantiated Integrity,Ascertain whether critical system elements have been corrupted.,Verify that you actually have what you think you have.
Unpredictability,Make changes randomly or unpredictably.,Keep the adversary guessing.
Uncertainty,,
