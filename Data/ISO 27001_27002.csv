A.5.1,5.1,Organizational controls,Policies for information security,"Information security policy and topic-specific policies shall be defined, approved by management, published, communicated to and acknowledged by relevant personnel and relevant interested parties, and reviewed at planned intervals and if significant changes occur.","To ensure continuing suitability, adequacy, effectiveness of management direction and support for information security in accordance with business, legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.","At the highest level, the organization should define an “information security policy” which is approved by top management and which sets out the organization’s approach to managing its information security. 
 
The information security policy should take into consideration requirements derived from: 
a) business strategy and requirements; 
b) regulations, legislation and contracts; 
c) the current and projected information security risks and threats. 
 
The information security policy should contain statements concerning: 
a) definition of information security; 
b) information security objectives or the framework for setting information security objectives; 
c) principles to guide all activities relating to information security; 
d) commitment to satisfy applicable requirements related to information security; 
e) commitment to continual improvement of the information security management system; 
f) assignment of responsibilities for information security management to defined roles; 
g) procedures for handling exemptions and exceptions. 
 
Top management should approve any changes to the information security policy. 
 
At a lower level, the information security policy should be supported by topic-specific policies as needed, to further mandate the implementation of information security controls. Topic-specific policies are typically structured to address the needs of certain target groups within an organization or to cover certain security areas. Topic-specific policies should be aligned with and complementary to the information security policy of the organization. 
 
Examples of such topics include: 
a) access control; 
b) physical and environmental security; 
c) asset management; 
d) information transfer; 
e) secure configuration and handling of user endpoint devices; 
f) networking security; 
g) information security incident management; 
h) backup; 
i) cryptography and key management; 
j) information classification and handling; 
k) management of technical vulnerabilities; 
l) secure development. 
 
The responsibility for the development, review and approval of the topic-specific policies should be allocated to relevant personnel based on their appropriate level of authority and technical competency. The review should include assessing opportunities for improvement of the organization’s information security policy and topic-specific policies and managing information security in response to changes to: 
a) the organization’s business strategy; 
b) the organization’s technical environment; 
c) regulations, statutes, legislation and contracts; 
d) information security risks; 
e) the current and projected information security threat environment; 
f) lessons learned from information security events and incidents. 
 
The review of information security policy and topic-specific policies should take the results of management reviews and audits into account. Review and update of other related policies should be considered when one policy is changed to maintain consistency. 
 
The information security policy and topic-specific policies should be communicated to relevant personnel and interested parties in a form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the intended reader. Recipients of the policies should be required to acknowledge they understand and agree to comply with the policies where applicable. The organization can determine the formats and names of these policy documents that meet the organization’s needs. In some organizations, the information security policy and topic-specific policies can be in a single document. The organization can name these topic-specific policies as standards, directives, policies or others.

A.5.2,5.2,Organizational controls,Information security roles and responsibilities,Information security roles and responsibilities shall be defined and allocated according to the organization needs.,"To establish a defined, approved and understood structure for the implementation, operation and management of information security within the organization.","Allocation of information security roles and responsibilities should be done in accordance with the information security policy and topic-specific policies (see 5.1). 
 
The organization should define and manage responsibilities for: 
a) protection of information and other associated assets; 
b) carrying out specific information security processes; 
c) information security risk management activities and in particular acceptance of residual risks (e.g. to risk owners); 
d) all personnel using an organization’s information and other associated assets. 
 
These responsibilities should be supplemented, where necessary, with more detailed guidance for specific sites and information processing facilities. Individuals with allocated information security responsibilities can assign security tasks to others. However, they remain accountable and should determine that any delegated tasks have been correctly performed. 
 
Each security area for which individuals are responsible should be defined, documented and communicated. Authorization levels should be defined and documented. Individuals who take on a specific information security role should be competent in the knowledge and skills required by the role and should be supported to keep up to date with developments related to the role and required in order to fulfil the responsibilities of the role.","Many organizations appoint an information security manager to take overall responsibility for the development and implementation of information security and to support the identification of risks and mitigating controls. 
 
However, responsibility for resourcing and implementing the controls often remains with individual managers. One common practice is to appoint an owner for each asset who then becomes responsible for its day-to-day protection. 
 
Depending on the size and resourcing of an organization, information security can be covered by dedicated roles or duties carried out in addition to existing roles.",Preventive,Identify
A.5.3,5.3,Organizational controls,Segregation of duties,Conflicting duties and conflicting areas of responsibility shall be segregated.,"To reduce the risk of fraud, error and bypassing of information security controls.","Segregation of duties and areas of responsibility aims to separate conflicting duties between different individuals in order to prevent one individual from executing potential conflicting duties on their own. 
 
The organization should determine which duties and areas of responsibility need to be segregated. The following are examples of activities that can require segregation: 
a) initiating, approving and executing a change; 
b) requesting, approving and implementing access rights; 
c) designing, implementing and reviewing code; 
d) developing software and administering production systems; 
e) using and administering applications; 
f) using applications and administering databases; g) designing, auditing and assuring information security controls. 
 
The possibility of collusion should be considered in designing the segregation controls. Small organizations can find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be applied as far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls should be considered, such as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision. 
 
Care should be taken when using role-based access control systems to ensure that persons are not granted conflicting roles. When there is a large number of roles, the organization should consider using automated tools to identify conflicts and facilitate their removal. Roles should be carefully defined and provisioned to minimize access problems if a role is removed or reassigned.",No other information.,Preventive,Protect

Management responsibilities should include ensuring that personnel: 
a) are properly briefed on their information security roles and responsibilities prior to being granted access to the organization’s information and other associated assets; 
b) are provided with guidelines which state the information security expectations of their role within the organization;

Contacts with authorities should also be used to facilitate the understanding about the current and upcoming expectations of these authorities (e.g. applicable information security regulations).","Organizations under attack can request authorities to take action against the attack source. 
 
Maintaining such contacts can be a requirement to support information security incident management (see 5.24 to 5.28) or the contingency planning and business continuity processes (see 5.29 and 5.30). Contacts with regulatory bodies are also useful to anticipate and prepare for upcoming changes in relevant laws or regulations that affect the organization.

A.5.7,5.7,Organizational controls,Threat intelligence,Information relating to information security threats shall be collected and analysed to produce threat intelligence.,To provide awareness of the organization’s threat environment so that the appropriate mitigation actions can be taken.,"Information about existing or emerging threats is collected and analyzed in order to: 
a) facilitate informed actions to prevent the threats from causing harm to the organization; 
b) reduce the impact of such threats. 
 
Threat intelligence can be divided into three layers, which should all be considered: 
a) strategic threat intelligence: exchange of high-level information about the changing threat landscape (e.g. types of attackers or types of attacks); 
b) tactical threat intelligence: information about attacker methodologies, tools and technologies involved; 
c) operational threat intelligence: details about specific attacks, including technical indicators. 
 
Threat intelligence should be: 
a) relevant (i.e. related to the protection of the organization); 
b) insightful (i.e. providing the organization with an accurate and detailed understanding of the threat landscape); 
c) contextual, to provide situational awareness (i.e. adding context to the information based on the time of events, where they occur, previous experiences and prevalence in similar organizations); 
d) actionable (i.e. the organization can act on information quickly and effectively). 
 
Threat intelligence activities should include: 
a) establishing objectives for threat intelligence production; 
b) identifying, vetting and selecting internal and external information sources that are necessary and appropriate to provide information required for the production of threat intelligence; 
c) collecting information from selected sources, which can be internal and external; 
d) processing information collected to prepare it for analysis (e.g. by translating, formatting or corroborating information); 
e) analyzing information to understand how it relates and is meaningful to the organization; 
f) communicating and sharing it to relevant individuals in a format that can be understood. 
 
Threat intelligence should be analyzed and later used: 
a) by implementing processes to include information gathered from threat intelligence sources into the organization’s information security risk management processes; 
b) as additional input to technical preventive and detective controls like firewalls, intrusion detection system, or anti malware solutions; 
c) as input to the information security test processes and techniques. 
 
The organization should share threat intelligence with other organizations on a mutual basis in order to improve overall threat intelligence.","Organizations can use threat intelligence to prevent, detect, or respond to threats. 
 
Organizations can produce threat intelligence, but more typically receive and make use of threat intelligence produced by other sources. 
 
Threat intelligence is often provided by independent providers or advisors, government agencies or collaborative threat intelligence groups. The effectiveness of controls such as 5.25, 8.7, 8.16 or 8.23, depends on the quality of available threat intelligence.","Preventive,Detective,Corrective","Identify,Detect,Respond"
A.5.8,5.8,Organizational controls,Information security in project management,Information security shall be integrated into project management.,To ensure information security risks related to projects and deliverables are effectively addressed in project management throughout the project life cycle.,"Information security should be integrated into project management to ensure information security risks are addressed as part of the project management. This can be applied to any type of project regardless of its complexity, size, duration, discipline or application area (e.g. a project for a core business process, ICT, facility management or other supporting processes). The project management in use should require that: a) information security risks are assessed and treated at an early stage and periodically as part of project risks throughout the project life cycle; b) information security requirements [e.g. application security requirements (8.26), requirements for complying with intellectual property rights (5.32), etc.] are addressed in the early stages of projects; c) information security risks associated with the execution of projects, such as security of internal and external communication aspects are considered and treated throughout the project life cycle; d) progress on information security risk treatment is reviewed and effectiveness of the treatment is evaluated and tested. The appropriateness of the information security considerations and activities should be followed up at predefined stages by suitable persons or governance bodies, such as the project steering committee. Responsibilities and authorities for information security relevant to the project should be defined and allocated to specified roles. Information security requirements for products or services to be delivered by the project should be determined using various methods, including deriving compliance requirements from information security policy, topic-specific policies and regulations. Further information security requirements can be derived from activities such as threat modelling, incident reviews, use of vulnerability thresholds or contingency planning, thus ensuring that the architecture and design of information systems are protected against known threats based on the operational environment. Information security requirements should be determined for all types of projects, not only ICT development projects. The following should also be considered when determining these requirements: a) what information is involved (information determination), what are the corresponding information security needs (classification; see 5.12) and the potential negative business impact which can result from lack of adequate security; b) the required protection needs of information and other associated assets involved, particularly in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability; c) the level of confidence or assurance required towards the claimed identity of entities in order to derive the authentication requirements; d) access provisioning and authorization processes, for customers and other potential business users as well as for privileged or technical users such as relevant project members, potential operation staff or external suppliers; e) informing users of their duties and responsibilities; f) requirements derived from business processes, such as transaction logging and monitoring, nonrepudiation requirements; g) requirements mandated by other information security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection systems); h) compliance with the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual environment in which the organization operates; i) level of confidence or assurance required for third parties to meet the organization’s information security policy and topic-specific policies including relevant security clauses in any agreements or contracts.","The project development approach, such as waterfall life cycle or agile life cycle, should support information security in a structured way that can be adapted to suit the assessed severity of the information security risks, based on the character of the project. Early consideration of information security requirements for the product or service (e.g. at the planning and design stages), can lead to more effective and cost-efficient solutions for quality and information security. ISO 21500 and ISO 21502 provide guidance on concepts and processes of project management that are important for the performance of projects. ISO/IEC 27005 provides guidance on the use of risk management processes to identify controls to meet information security requirements.",Preventive,"Identify,Protect"
A.5.9,5.9,Organizational controls,Inventory of information and other associated assets,"An inventory of information and other associated assets, including owners, shall be developed and maintained.",To identify the organization’s information and other associated assets in order to preserve their information security and assign appropriate ownership. ﻿,"Inventory The organization should identify its information and other associated assets and determine their importance in terms of information security. Documentation should be maintained in dedicated or existing inventories as appropriate. The inventory of information and other associated assets should be accurate, up to date, consistent and aligned with other inventories. Options for ensuring accuracy of an inventory of information and other associated assets include: a) conducting regular reviews of identified information and other associated assets against the asset inventory; b) automatically enforcing an inventory update in the process of installing, changing or removing an asset. The location of an asset should be included in the inventory as appropriate. The inventory does not need to be a single list of information and other associated assets. Considering that the inventory should be maintained by the relevant functions, it can be seen as a set of dynamic inventories, such as inventories for information assets, hardware, software, virtual machines (VMs), facilities, personnel, competence, capabilities and records. Each asset should be classified in accordance with the classification of the information (see 5.12) associated to that asset. The granularity of the inventory of information and other associated assets should be at a level appropriate for the needs of the organization. Sometimes specific instances of assets in the information life cycle are not feasible to be documented due to the nature of the asset. An example of a short-lived asset is a VM instance whose life cycle can be of short duration. Ownership For the identified information and other associated assets, ownership of the asset should be assigned to an individual or a group and the classification should be identified (see 5.12, 5.13). A process to ensure timely assignment of asset ownership should be implemented. Ownership should be assigned when assets are created or when assets are transferred to the organization. Asset ownership should be reassigned as necessary when current asset owners leave or change job roles. Owner duties The asset owner should be responsible for the proper management of an asset over the whole asset life cycle, ensuring that: a) information and other associated assets are inventoried; b) information and other associated assets are appropriately classified and protected; c) the classification is reviewed periodically; d) components supporting technology assets are listed and linked, such as database, storage, software components and sub-components; e) requirements for the acceptable use of information and other associated assets (see 5.10) are established; f) access restrictions correspond with the classification and that they are effective and are reviewed periodically; g) information and other associated assets, when deleted or disposed, are handled in a secure manner and removed from the inventory; h) they are involved in the identification and management of risks associated with their asset(s); i) they support personnel who have the roles and responsibilities of managing their information.","Inventories of information and other associated assets are often necessary to ensure the effective protection of information and can be required for other purposes, such as health and safety, insurance or financial reasons. Inventories of information and other associated assets also support risk management, audit activities, vulnerability management, incident response and recovery planning. Tasks and responsibilities can be delegated (e.g. to a custodian looking after the assets on a daily basis), but the person or group who delegated them remains accountable. It can be useful to designate groups of information and other associated assets which act together to provide a particular service. In this case, the owner of this service is accountable for the delivery of the service, including the operation of its assets. See ISO/IEC 19770-1 for additional information on information technology (IT) asset management. See ISO 55001 for additional information on asset management.",Preventive,Identify

They should be responsible for their use of any information processing facilities. The organization should establish a topic-specific policy on the acceptable use of information and other associated assets and communicate it to anyone who uses or handles information and other associated assets. The topic-specific policy on acceptable use should provide clear direction on how individuals are expected to use information and other associated assets. The topic-specific policy should state: a) expected and unacceptable behaviors of individuals from an information security perspective; b) permitted and prohibited use of information and other associated assets; c) monitoring activities being performed by the organization. Acceptable use procedures should be drawn up for the full information life cycle in accordance with its classification (see 5.12) and determined risks. The following items should be considered: a) access restrictions supporting the protection requirements for each level of classification; b) maintenance of a record of the authorized users of information and other associated assets; c) protection of temporary or permanent copies of information to a level consistent with the protection of the original information; d) storage of assets associated with information in accordance with manufacturers’ specifications (see 7.8); e) clear marking of all copies of storage media (electronic or physical) for the attention of the authorized recipient (see 7.10); f) authorization of disposal of information and other associated assets and supported deletion method(s) (see 8.10).,"It can be the case that the assets concerned do not directly belong to the organization, such as public cloud services. The use of such third-party assets and any assets of the organization associated with such external assets (e.g. information, software) should be identified as applicable and controlled, for example, through agreements with cloud service providers.

In cases where personnel and other interested parties purchase the organization’s equipment or use their own personal equipment, procedures should be followed to ensure that all relevant information is traced and transferred to the organization and securely deleted from the equipment (see 7.14). In cases where personnel and other interested parties have knowledge that is important to ongoing operations, that information should be documented and transferred to the organization. During the notice period and thereafter, the organization should prevent unauthorized copying of relevant information (e.g. intellectual property) by personnel under notice of termination. The organization should clearly identify and document all information and other associated assets to be returned which can include: a) user endpoint devices; b) portable storage devices; c) specialist equipment; d) authentication hardware (e.g. mechanical keys, physical tokens and smartcards) for information systems, sites and physical archives; e) physical copies of information.","It can be difficult to return information held on assets which are not owned by the organization.

A.5.12,5.12,Organizational controls,Classification of information,"Information shall be classified according to the information security needs of the organization based on confidentiality, integrity, availability and relevant interested party requirements.",To ensure identification and understanding of protection needs of information in accordance with its importance to the organization.,"The organization should establish a topic-specific policy on information classification and communicate it to all relevant interested parties. The organization should take into account requirements for confidentiality, integrity and availability in the classification scheme. Classifications and associated protective controls for information should take account of business needs for sharing or restricting information, for protecting integrity of information and for assuring availability, as well as legal requirements concerning the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information. Assets other than information can also be classified in compliance with classification of information, which is stored in, processed by or otherwise handled or protected by the asset. Owners of information should be accountable for their classification. The classification scheme should include conventions for classification and criteria for review of the classification over time. Results of classification should be updated in accordance with changes of the value, sensitivity and criticality of information through their life cycle. The scheme should be aligned to the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.1) and should be able to address specific business needs of the organization. The classification can be determined by the level of impact that the information's compromise would have for the organization. Each level defined in the scheme should be given a name that makes sense in the context of the classification scheme’s application. The scheme should be consistent across the whole organization and included in its procedures so that everyone classifies information and applicable other associated assets in the same way. In this manner, everyone has a common understanding of protection requirements and applies appropriate protection. The classification scheme used within the organization can be different from the schemes used by other organizations, even if the names for levels are similar. In addition, information moving between organizations can vary in classification depending on its context in each organization, even if their classification schemes are identical. Therefore, agreements with other organizations that include information sharing should include procedures to identify the classification of that information and to interpret the classification levels from other organizations. Correspondence between different schemes can be determined by looking for equivalence in the associated handling and protection methods.","Classification provides people who deal with information with a concise indication of how to handle and protect it. Creating groups of information with similar protection needs and specifying information security procedures that apply to all the information in each group facilitates this. This approach reduces the need for case-by-case risk assessment and custom design of controls. Information can cease to be sensitive or critical after a certain period of time. For example, when the information has been made public, it no longer has confidentiality requirements but can still require protection for its integrity and availability properties. These aspects should be taken into account, as over-classification can lead to the implementation of unnecessary controls resulting in additional expense or, on the contrary, under-classification can lead to insufficient controls to protect the information from compromise. As an example, an information confidentiality classification scheme can be based on four levels as follows: a) disclosure causes no harm; b) disclosure causes minor reputational damage or minor operational impact; c) disclosure has a significant short-term impact on operations or business objectives; d) disclosure has a serious impact on long term business objectives or puts the survival of the organization at risk.",Preventive,Identify
A.5.13,5.13,Organizational controls,Labelling of information,An appropriate set of procedures for information labelling shall be developed and implemented in accordance with the information classification scheme adopted by the organization.,To facilitate the communication of classification of information and support automation of information processing and management.,"Procedures for information labelling should cover information and other associated assets in all formats. The labelling should reflect the classification scheme established in 5.12. The labels should be easily recognizable. The procedures should give guidance on where and how labels are attached in consideration of how the information is accessed or the assets are handled depending on the types of storage media. The procedures can define: a) cases where labelling is omitted (e.g. labelling of non-confidential information to reduce workloads); b) how to label information sent by or stored on electronic or physical means, or any other format; c) how to handle cases where labelling is not possible (e.g. due to technical restrictions). Examples of labelling techniques include: a) physical labels; b) headers and footers; c) metadata; d) watermarking; e) rubber-stamps. Digital information should utilize metadata in order to identify, manage and control information, especially with regard to confidentiality. Metadata should also enable efficient and correct searching for information. Metadata should facilitate systems to interact and make decisions based on the associated classification labels. The procedures should describe how to attach metadata to information, what labels to use and how data should be handled, in line with the organization’s information model and ICT architecture. Relevant additional metadata should be added by systems when they process information depending on its information security properties. Personnel and other interested parties should be made aware of labelling procedures. All personnel should be provided with the necessary training to ensure that information is correctly labelled and handled accordingly. Output from systems containing information that is classified as being sensitive or critical should carry an appropriate classification label.",Labelling of classified information is a key requirement for information sharing. Other useful metadata that can be attached to the information is which organizational process created the information and at what time. Labelling of information and other associated assets can sometimes have negative effects. Classified assets can be easier to identify by malicious actors for potential misuse. Some systems do not label individual files or database records with their classification but protect all information at the highest level of classification of any of the information that it contains or is permitted to contain. It is usual in such systems to determine and then label information when it is exported.,Preventive,Protect
A.5.14,5.14,Organizational controls,Information transfer,"Information transfer rules, procedures, or agreements shall be in place for all types of transfer facilities within the organization and between the organization and other parties.",To maintain the security of information transferred within an organization and with any external interested party.,"General The organization should establish and communicate a topic-specific policy on information transfer to all relevant interested parties. Rules, procedures and agreements to protect information in transit should reflect the classification of the information involved. Where information is transferred between the organization and third parties, transfer agreements (including recipient authentication) should be established and maintained to protect information in all forms in transit (see 5.10). Information transfer can happen through electronic transfer, physical storage media transfer and verbal transfer. For all types of information transfer, rules, procedures and agreements should include: a) controls designed to protect transferred information from interception, unauthorized access, copying, modification, misrouting, destruction and denial of service, including levels of access control commensurate with the classification of the information involved and any special controls that are required to protect sensitive information, such as use of cryptographic techniques (see 8.24); b) controls to ensure traceability and non-repudiation, including maintaining a chain of custody for information while in transit; c) identification of appropriate contacts related to the transfer including information owners, risk owners, security officers and information custodians, as applicable; d) responsibilities and liabilities in the event of information security incidents, such as loss of physical storage media or data; e) use of an agreed labelling system for sensitive or critical information, ensuring that the meaning of the labels is immediately understood and that the information is appropriately protected (see 5.13); f) reliability and availability of the transfer service; g) the topic-specific policy or guidelines on acceptable use of information transfer facilities (see 5.10); h) retention and disposal guidelines for all business records, including messages; NOTE Local legislation and regulations can exist regarding retention and disposal of business records. i) the consideration of any other relevant legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements (see 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34) related to transfer of information (e.g. requirements for electronic signatures). Electronic transfer Rules, procedures and agreements should also consider the following items when using electronic communication facilities for information transfer: a) detection of and protection against malware that can be transmitted through the use of electronic communications (see 8.7); b) protection of communicated sensitive electronic information that is in the form of an attachment; c) prevention against sending documents and messages in communications to the wrong address or number; d) obtaining approval prior to using external public services such as instant messaging, social networking, file sharing or cloud storage; e) stronger levels of authentication when transferring information via publicly accessible networks; f) restrictions associated with electronic communication facilities (e.g. preventing automatic forwarding of electronic mail to external mail addresses); g) advising personnel and other interested parties not to send short message service (SMS) or instant messages with critical information since these can be read in public places (and therefore by unauthorized persons) or stored in devices not adequately protected; h) advising personnel and other interested parties about the problems of using fax machines or services, namely: 1) unauthorized access to built-in message stores to retrieve messages; 2) deliberate or accidental programming of machines to send messages to specific numbers. Physical storage media transfer When transferring physical storage media (including paper), rules, procedures and agreements should also include: a) responsibilities for controlling and notifying transmission, dispatch and receipt; b) ensuring correct addressing and transportation of the message; c) packaging that protects the contents from any physical damage likely to arise during transit and in accordance with any manufacturers’ specifications, for example protecting against any environmental factors that can reduce the effectiveness of restoring storage media such as exposure to heat, moisture or electromagnetic fields; using minimum technical standards for packaging and transmission (e.g. the use of opaque envelopes); d) a list of authorized reliable couriers agreed by management; e) courier identification standards; f) depending on the classification level of the information in the storage media to be transported, use tamper evident or tamper-resistant controls (e.g. bags, containers); g) procedures to verify the identification of couriers; h) approved list of third parties providing transportation or courier services depending on the classification of the information; i) keeping logs for identifying the content of the storage media, the protection applied as well as recording the list of authorized recipients, the times of transfer to the transit custodians and receipt at the destination. Verbal transfer To protect verbal transfer of information, personnel and other interested parties should be reminded that they should: a) not have confidential verbal conversations in public places or over insecure communication channels since these can be overheard by unauthorized persons; b) not leave messages containing confidential information on answering machines or voice messages since these can be replayed by unauthorized persons, stored on communal systems or stored incorrectly as a result of misdialing; c) be screened to the appropriate level to listen to the conversation; d) ensure that appropriate room controls are implemented (e.g. sound-proofing, closed door); e) begin any sensitive conversations with a disclaimer so those present know the classification level and any handling requirements of what they are about to hear.",No other information.,Preventive,Protect
A.5.15,5.15,Organizational controls,Access control,Rules to control physical and logical access to information and other associated assets shall be established and implemented based on business and information security requirements.,To ensure authorized access and to prevent unauthorized access to information and other associated assets.,"Owners of information and other associated assets should determine information security and business requirements related to access control. A topic-specific policy on access control should be defined which takes account of these requirements and should be communicated to all relevant interested parties. These requirements and the topic-specific policy should consider the following: a) determining which entities require which type of access to the information and other associated assets; b) security of applications (see 8.26); c) physical access, which needs to be supported by appropriate physical entry controls (see 7.2, 7.3, 7.4); d) information dissemination and authorization (e.g. the need-to-know principle) and information security levels and classification of information (see 5.10, 5.12, 5.13); e) restrictions to privileged access (see 8.2); f) segregation of duties (see 5.3); g) relevant legislation, regulations and any contractual obligations regarding limitation of access to data or services (see 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34, 8.3); h) segregation of access control functions (e.g. access request, access authorization, access administration); i) formal authorization of access requests (see 5.16 and 5.18); j) the management of access rights (see 5.18); k) logging (see 8.15). Owners of information and other associated assets should determine information security and business requirements related to access control. A topic-specific policy on access control should be defined which takes account of these requirements and should be communicated to all relevant interested parties.

Access control rules should be implemented by defining and mapping appropriate access rights and restrictions to the relevant entities (see 5.16). An entity can represent a human user as well as a technical or logical item (e.g. a machine, device or a service). To simplify the access control management, specific roles can be assigned to entity groups. The following should be taken into account when defining and implementing access control rules: a) consistency between the access rights and information classification; b) consistency between the access rights and the physical perimeter security needs and requirements; c) considering all types of available connections in distributed environments so entities are only provided with access to information and other associated assets, including networks and network services, that they are authorized to use; d) considering how elements or factors relevant to dynamic access control can be reflected.","There are often overarching principles used in the context of access control. Two of the most frequently used principles are: a) need-to-know: an entity is only granted access to the information which that entity requires in order to perform its tasks (different tasks or roles mean different need-to-know information and hence different access profiles); b) need-to-use: an entity is only assigned access to information technology infrastructure where a clear need is present. Care should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider: a) establishing rules based on the premise of least privilege, “Everything is generally forbidden unless expressly permitted”, rather than the weaker rule, “Everything is generally permitted unless expressly forbidden”; b) changes in information labels (see 5.13) that are initiated automatically by information processing facilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user; c) changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those initiated by an administrator; d) when to define and regularly review the approval. Access control rules should be supported by documented procedures (see 5.16, 5.17, 5.18, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.18) and defined responsibilities (see 5.2, 5.17). There are several ways to implement access control, such as MAC (mandatory access control), DAC (discretionary access control), RBAC (role-based access control) and ABAC (attribute-based access control). Access control rules can also contain dynamic elements (e.g. a function that evaluates past accesses or specific environment values). Access control rules can be implemented in different granularity, ranging from covering whole networks or systems to specific data fields and can also consider properties such as user location or the type of network connection that is used for access. These principles and how granular access control is defined can have a significant cost impact. Stronger rules and more granularity typically lead to higher cost. Business requirements and risk considerations should be used to define which access control rules are applied and which granularity is required.",Preventive,Protect
A.5.16,5.16,Organizational controls,Identity management,The full life cycle of identities shall be managed.,To allow for the unique identification of individuals and systems accessing the organization’s information and other associated assets and to enable appropriate assignment of access rights.,"The processes used in the context of identity management should ensure that: a) for identities assigned to persons, a specific identity is only linked to a single person to be able to hold the person accountable for actions performed with this specific identity; b) identities assigned to multiple persons (e.g. shared identities) are only permitted where they are necessary for business or operational reasons and are subject to dedicated approval and documentation; c) identities assigned to non-human entities are subject to appropriately segregated approval and independent ongoing oversight; d) identities are disabled or removed in a timely fashion if they are no longer required (e.g. if their associated entities are deleted or no longer used, or if the person linked to an identity has left the organization or changed the role); e) in a specific domain, a single identity is mapped to a single entity, [i.e. mapping of multiple identities to the same entity within the same context (duplicate identities) is avoided]; f) records of all significant events concerning the use and management of user identities and of authentication information are kept. The organization should have a supporting process in place to handle changes to information related to user identities. These processes can include re-verification of trusted documents related to a person. When using identities provided or issued by third parties (e.g. social media credentials), the organization should ensure the third-party identities provide the required trust level and any associated risks are known and sufficiently treated. This can include controls related to the third parties (see 5.19) as well as controls related to associated authentication information (see 5.17).","Providing or revoking access to information and other associated assets is usually a multi-step procedure: a) confirming the business requirements for an identity to be established; b) verifying the identity of an entity before allocating them a logical identity; c) establishing an identity; d) configuring and activating the identity. This also includes configuration and initial setup of related authentication services; e) providing or revoking specific access rights to the identity, based on appropriate authorization or entitlement decisions (see 5.18).",Preventive,Protect
A.5.17,5.17,Organizational controls,Authentication information,"Allocation and management of authentication information shall be controlled by a management process, including advising personnel on appropriate handling of authentication information.",To ensure proper entity authentication and prevent failures of authentication processes.,"Allocation of authentication information The allocation and management process should ensure that: a) personal passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) generated automatically during enrolment processes as temporary secret authentication information are non-guessable and unique for each person, and that users are required to change them after the first use; b) procedures are established to verify the identity of a user prior to providing new, replacement or temporary authentication information; c) authentication information, including temporary authentication information, is transmitted to users in a secure manner (e.g. over an authenticated and protected channel) and the use of unprotected (clear text) electronic mail messages for this purpose is avoided; d) users acknowledge receipt of authentication information; e) default authentication information as predefined or provided by vendors is changed immediately following installation of systems or software; f) records of significant events concerning allocation and management of authentication information are kept and their confidentiality is granted, and that the record-keeping method is approved (e.g. by using an approved password vault tool). User responsibilities Any person having access to or using authentication information should be advised to ensure that: a) secret authentication information such as passwords are kept confidential. Personal secret authentication information is not to be shared with anyone. Secret authentication information used in the context of identities linked to multiple users or linked to non-personal entities are solely shared with authorized persons; b) affected or compromised authentication information is changed immediately upon notification of or any other indication of a compromise; c) when passwords are used as authentication information, strong passwords according to best practice recommendations are selected, for example: 1) passwords are not based on anything somebody else can easily guess or obtain using person related information (e.g. names, telephone numbers and dates of birth); 2) passwords are not based on dictionary words or combinations thereof; 3) use easy to remember passphrases and try to include alphanumerical and special characters; 4) passwords have a minimum length; d) the same passwords are not used across distinct services and systems; e) the obligation to follow these rules is also included in terms and conditions of employment (see 6.2). Password management system When passwords are used as authentication information, the password management system should: a) allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a confirmation procedure to address input errors; b) enforce strong passwords according to good practice recommendations [see c) of ""User responsibilities]; c) force users to change their passwords at first login; d) enforce password changes as necessary, for example after a security incident, or upon termination or change of employment when a user has known passwords for identities that remain active (e.g. shared identities); e) prevent re-use of previous passwords; f) prevent the use of commonly-used passwords and compromised usernames, password combinations from hacked systems; g) not display passwords on the screen when being entered; h) store and transmit passwords in protected form. Password encryption and hashing should be performed according to approved cryptographic techniques for passwords (see 8.24).","Passwords or passphrases are a commonly used type of authentication information and are a common means of verifying a user’s identity. Other types of authentication information are cryptographic keys, data stored on hardware tokens (e.g. smart cards) that produce authentication codes and biometric data such as iris scans or fingerprints. Additional information can be found in the ISO/IEC 24760 series. Requiring frequent change of passwords can be problematic because users can get annoyed by the frequent changes, forget new passwords, note them down in unsafe places, or choose unsafe passwords. Provision of single sign on (SSO) or other authentication management tools (e.g. password vaults) reduces the amount of authentication information that users are required to protect and can thereby increase the effectiveness of this control. However, these tools can also increase the impact of disclosure of authentication information. Some applications require user passwords to be assigned by an independent authority. In such cases, a), c) and d) of ""Password management system"" do not apply.",Preventive,Protect

Separate approval for access rights by management can also be appropriate; b) considering the business requirements and the organization’s topic-specific policy and rules on access control; c) considering segregation of duties, including segregating the roles of approval and implementation of the access rights and separation of conflicting roles; d) ensuring access rights are removed when someone does not need to access the information and other associated assets, in particular ensuring access rights of users who have left the organization are removed in a timely fashion; e) considering giving temporary access rights for a limited time period and revoking them at the expiration date, in particular for temporary personnel or temporary access required by personnel; f) verifying that the level of access granted is in accordance with the topic-specific policies on access control (see 5.15) and is consistent with other information security requirements such as segregation of duties (see 5.3); g) ensuring that access rights are activated (e.g. by service providers) only after authorization procedures are successfully completed; h) maintaining a central record of access rights granted to a user identifier (ID, logical or physical) to access information and other associated assets; i) modifying access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs; j) removing or adjusting physical and logical access rights, which can be done by removal, revocation or replacement of keys, authentication information, identification cards or subscriptions; k) maintaining a record of changes to users’ logical and physical access rights. Review of access rights Regular reviews of physical and logical access rights should consider the following: a) users’ access rights after any change within the same organization (e.g. job change, promotion, demotion) or termination of employment (see 6.1 to 6.5); b) authorizations for privileged access rights. Consideration before change or termination of employment A user’s access rights to information and other associated assets should be reviewed and adjusted or removed before any change or termination of employment based on the evaluation of risk factors such as: a) whether the termination or change is initiated by the user or by management and the reason for termination; b) the current responsibilities of the user; c) the value of the assets currently accessible.","Consideration should be given to establishing user access roles based on business requirements that summarize a number of access rights into typical user access profiles. Access requests and reviews of access rights are easier managed at the level of such roles than at the level of particular rights. Consideration should be given to including clauses in personnel contracts and service contracts that specify sanctions if unauthorized access is attempted by personnel (see 5.20, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6). In cases of management-initiated termination, disgruntled personnel or external party users can deliberately corrupt information or sabotage information processing facilities. In cases of persons resigning or being dismissed, they can be tempted to collect information for future use. Cloning is an efficient way for organizations to assign access to users. However, it should be done with care based on distinct roles identified by the organization rather than just cloning an identity with all associated access rights. Cloning has an inherent risk of resulting in excessive access rights to information and other associated assets.",Preventive,Protect

The organization should identify and implement processes and procedures to address security risks associated with the use of products and services provided by suppliers. This should also apply to the organization’s use of resources of cloud service providers. These processes and procedures should include those to be implemented by the organization, as well as those the organization requires the supplier to implement for the commencement of use of a supplier’s products or services or for the termination of use of a supplier’s products and services, such as: a) identifying and documenting the types of suppliers (e.g. ICT services, logistics, utilities, financial services, ICT infrastructure components) which can affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the organization's information; b) establishing how to evaluate and select suppliers according to the sensitivity of information, products and services (e.g. with market analysis, customer references, review of documents, onsite assessments, certifications); c) evaluating and selecting supplier’s products or services that have adequate information security controls and reviewing them; in particular, accuracy and completeness of controls implemented by the supplier that ensure integrity of the supplier’s information and information processing and hence the organization’s information security; d) defining the organization’s information, ICT services and the physical infrastructure that suppliers can access, monitor, control or use; e) defining the types of ICT infrastructure components and services provided by suppliers which can affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the organization's information; f) assessing and managing the information security risks associated with: 1) the suppliers’ use of the organization’s information and other associated assets, including risks originating from potential malicious supplier personnel; 2) malfunctioning or vulnerabilities of the products (including software components and subcomponents used in these products) or services provided by the suppliers; g) monitoring compliance with established information security requirements for each type of supplier and type of access, including third-party review and product validation; h) mitigating non-compliance of a supplier, whether this was detected through monitoring or by other means; i) handling incidents and contingencies associated with supplier products and services including responsibilities of both the organization and suppliers; j) resilience and, if necessary, recovery and contingency measures to ensure the availability of the supplier’s information and information processing and hence the availability of the organization’s information; k) awareness and training for the organization’s personnel interacting with supplier personnel regarding appropriate rules of engagement, topic-specific policies, processes and procedures and behavior based on the type of supplier and the level of supplier access to the organization’s systems and information; l) managing the necessary transfer of information, other associated assets and anything else that needs to be changed and ensuring that information security is maintained throughout the transfer period; m) requirements to ensure a secure termination of the supplier relationship, including: 1) de-provisioning of access rights; 2) information handling; 3) determining ownership of intellectual property developed during the engagement; 4) information portability in case of change of supplier or insourcing; 6) records management; 7) return of assets; 8) secure disposal of information and other associated assets; 9) ongoing confidentiality requirements; n) level of personnel security and physical security expected from supplier's personnel and facilities. The procedures for continuing information processing in the event that the supplier becomes unable to supply its products or services (e.g. because of an incident, because the supplier is no longer in business, or no longer provides some components due to technology advancements) should be considered to avoid any delay in arranging replacement products or services (e.g. identifying an alternative supplier in advance or always using alternative suppliers).","In cases where it is not possible for an organization to place requirements on a supplier, the organization should: a) consider the guidance given in this control in making decisions about choosing a supplier and its product or service; b) implement compensating controls as necessary based on a risk assessment. Information can be put at risk by suppliers with inadequate information security management. Controls should be determined and applied to manage the supplier's access to information and other associated assets. For example, if there is a special need for confidentiality of the information, non-disclosure agreements or cryptographic techniques can be used. Another example is personal data protection risks when the supplier agreement involves transfer of, or access to, information across borders. The organization needs to be aware that the legal or contractual responsibility for protecting information remains with the organization. Risks can also be caused by inadequate controls of ICT infrastructure components or services provided by suppliers.

Examples of such supplier review methods can include penetration testing and proof or validation of third-party attestations for the supplier’s information security operations; g) implementing a process for identifying and documenting product or service components that are critical for maintaining functionality and therefore require increased attention, scrutiny and further follow up required when built outside of the organization especially if the supplier outsources aspects of product or service components to other suppliers; h) obtaining assurance that critical components and their origin can be traced throughout the supply chain; i) obtaining assurance that the delivered ICT products are functioning as expected without any unexpected or unwanted features; j) implementing processes to ensure that components from suppliers are genuine and unaltered from their specification. Example measures include anti-tamper labels, cryptographic hash verifications or digital signatures. Monitoring for out of specification performance can be an indicator of tampering or counterfeits. Prevention and detection of tampering should be implemented during multiple stages in the system development life cycle, including design, development, integration, operations and maintenance; k) obtaining assurance that ICT products achieve required security levels, for example, through formal certification or an evaluation scheme such as the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement; l) defining rules for sharing of information regarding the supply chain and any potential issues and compromises among the organization and suppliers; m) implementing specific processes for managing ICT component life cycle and availability and associated security risks. This includes managing the risks of components no longer being available due to suppliers no longer being in business or suppliers no longer providing these components due to technology advancements. Identification of an alternative supplier and the process to transfer software and competence to the alternative supplier should be considered.","The specific ICT supply chain risk management practices are built on top of general information security, quality, project management and system engineering practices but do not replace them. Organizations are advised to work with suppliers to understand the ICT supply chain and any matters that have an important effect on the products and services being provided. The organization can influence ICT supply chain information security practices by making clear in agreements with their suppliers the matters that should be addressed by other suppliers in the ICT supply chain. ICT should be acquired from reputable sources. The reliability of software and hardware is a matter of quality control. While it is generally not possible for an organization to inspect the quality control systems of its vendors, it can make reliable judgments based on the reputation of the vendor. ICT supply chain as addressed here includes cloud services. Examples of ICT supply chains are: a) cloud services provisioning, where the cloud service provider relies on the software developers, telecommunication service providers, hardware providers; b) IoT, where the service involves the device manufacturers, the cloud service providers (e.g. the IoT platform operators), the developers for mobile and web applications, the vendor of software libraries; c) hosting services, where the provider relies on external service desks including first, second and third support levels. See ISO/IEC 27036-3 for more details including risk assessment guidance.

The organization should define: a) all relevant information security requirements associated with the use of the cloud services; b) cloud service selection criteria and scope of cloud service usage; c) roles and responsibilities related to the use and management of cloud services; d) which information security controls are managed by the cloud service provider and which are managed by the organization as the cloud service customer; e) how to obtain and utilize information security capabilities provided by the cloud service provider; f) how to obtain assurance on information security controls implemented by cloud service providers; g) how to manage controls, interfaces and changes in services when an organization uses multiple cloud services, particularly from different cloud service providers; h) procedures for handling information security incidents that occur in relation to the use of cloud services; i) its approach for monitoring, reviewing and evaluating the ongoing use of cloud services to manage information security risks; j) how to change or stop the use of cloud services including exit strategies for cloud services. Cloud service agreements are often pre-defined and not open to negotiation. For all cloud services, the organization should review cloud service agreements with the cloud service provider(s). A cloud service agreement should address the confidentiality, integrity, availability and information handling requirements of the organization, with appropriate cloud service level objectives and cloud service qualitative objectives. The organization should also undertake relevant risk assessments to identify the risks associated with using the cloud service. Any residual risks connected to the use of the cloud service should be clearly identified and accepted by the appropriate management of the organization. An agreement between the cloud service provider and the organization, acting as the cloud service customer, should include the following provisions for the protection of the organization’s data and availability of services: a) providing solutions based on industry accepted standards for architecture and infrastructure; b) managing access controls of the cloud service to meet the requirements of the organization; c) implementing malware monitoring and protection solutions; d) processing and storing the organization’s sensitive information in approved locations (e.g. particular country or region) or within or subject to a particular jurisdiction; e) providing dedicated support in the event of an information security incident in the cloud service environment; f) ensuring that the organization’s information security requirements are met in the event of cloud services being further sub-contracted to an external supplier (or prohibiting cloud services from being sub-contracted); g) supporting the organization in gathering digital evidence, taking into consideration laws and regulations for digital evidence across different jurisdictions; h) providing appropriate support and availability of services for an appropriate time frame when the organization wants to exit from the cloud service; i) providing required backup of data and configuration information and securely managing backups as applicable, based on the capabilities of the cloud service provider used by the organization, acting as the cloud service customer; j) providing and returning information such as configuration files, source code and data that are owned by the organization, acting as the cloud service customer, when requested during the service provision or at termination of service. The organization, acting as the cloud service customer, should consider whether the agreement should require cloud service providers to provide advance notification prior to any substantive customer impacting changes being made to the way the service is delivered to the organization, including: a) changes to the technical infrastructure (e.g. relocation, reconfiguration, or changes in hardware or software) that affect or change the cloud service offering; b) processing or storing information in a new geographical or legal jurisdiction; c) use of peer cloud service providers or other sub-contractors (including changing existing or using new parties). The organization using cloud services should maintain close contact with its cloud service providers. These contacts enable mutual exchange of information about information security for the use of the cloud services including a mechanism for both cloud service provider and the organization, acting as the cloud service customer, to monitor each service characteristic and report failures to the commitments contained in the agreements.","This control considers cloud security from the perspective of the cloud service customer.

The ICT continuity requirements are the outcome of the business impact analysis (BIA). The BIA process should use impact types and criteria to assess the impacts over time resulting from the disruption of business activities that deliver products and services. The magnitude and duration of the resulting impact should be used to identify prioritized activities which should be assigned a recovery time objective (RTO). The BIA should then determine which resources are needed to support prioritized activities. An RTO should also be specified for these resources. A subset of these resources should include ICT services. The BIA involving ICT services can be expanded to define performance and capacity requirements of ICT systems and recovery point objectives (RPO) of information required to support activities during disruption.

Initial awareness, education and training can apply to new personnel and to those who transfer to new positions or roles with substantially different information security requirements. Personnel’s understanding should be assessed at the end of an awareness, education or training activity to test knowledge transfer and the effectiveness of the awareness, education and training programme. Awareness An information security awareness programme should aim to make personnel aware of their responsibilities for information security and the means by which those responsibilities are discharged. The awareness programme should be planned taking into consideration the roles of personnel in the organization, including internal and external personnel (e.g. external consultants, supplier personnel). The activities in the awareness programme should be scheduled over time, preferably regularly, so that the activities are repeated and cover new personnel. It should also be built on lessons learnt from information security incidents. The awareness programme should include a number of awareness-raising activities via appropriate physical or virtual channels such as campaigns, booklets, posters, newsletters, websites, information sessions, briefings, e-learning modules and e-mails. Information security awareness should cover general aspects such as: a) management’s commitment to information security throughout the organization; b) familiarity and compliance needs concerning applicable information security rules and obligations, taking into account information security policy and topic-specific policies, standards, laws, statutes, regulations, contracts and agreements; c) personal accountability for one’s own actions and inactions, and general responsibilities towards securing or protecting information belonging to the organization and interested parties; d) basic information security procedures [e.g. information security event reporting (6.8)] and baseline controls [e.g. password security (5.17)]; e) contact points and resources for additional information and advice on information security matters, including further information security awareness materials. Education and training The organization should identify, prepare and implement an appropriate training plan for technical teams whose roles require specific skill sets and expertise. Technical teams should have the skills for configuring and maintaining the required security level for devices, systems, applications and services. If there are missing skills, the organization should take action and acquire them. The education and training programme should consider different forms [e.g. lectures or self-studies, being mentored by expert staff or consultants (on-the-job training), rotating staff members to follow different activities, recruiting already skilled people and hiring consultants]. It can use different means of delivery including classroom-based, distance learning, web-based, self-paced and others. Technical personnel should keep their knowledge up to date by subscribing to newsletters and magazines or by attending conferences and events aimed at technical and professional improvement.","When composing an awareness programme, it is important not only to focus on the ’what’ and ’how’, but also the ’why’, when possible. It is important that personnel understand the aim of information security and the potential effect, positive and negative, on the organization of their own behavior.

Storage media containing confidential or copyrighted information should be physically destroyed or the information should be destroyed, deleted or overwritten using techniques to make the original information non-retrievable rather than using the standard delete function. See 7.10 for detailed guidance on secure disposal of storage media and 8.10 for guidance on information deletion. Labels and markings identifying the organization or indicating the classification, owner, system or network, should be removed prior to disposal, including reselling or donating to charity. The organization should consider the removal of security controls such as access controls or surveillance equipment at the end of lease or when moving out of premises. This depends on factors such as: a) its lease agreement to return the facility to original condition; b) minimizing the risk of leaving systems with sensitive information on them for the next tenant (e.g. user access lists, video or image files); c) the ability to reuse the controls at the next facility.","Damaged equipment containing storage media can require a risk assessment to determine whether the items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded. Information can be compromised through careless disposal or re-use of equipment. In addition to secure disk deletion, full-disk encryption reduces the risk of disclosure of confidential information when equipment is disposed of or redeployed, provided that: a) the encryption process is sufficiently strong and covers the entire disk (including slack space, swap files); b) the cryptographic keys are long enough to resist brute force attacks; c) the cryptographic keys are themselves kept confidential (e.g. never stored on the same disk). For further advice on cryptography, see 8.24.

A.8.1,8.1,Technological controls,User end point devices,"Information stored on, processed by or accessible via user end point devices shall be protected.",To protect information against the risks introduced by using user endpoint devices.,"General The organization should establish a topic-specific policy on secure configuration and handling of user endpoint devices. The topic-specific policy should be communicated to all relevant personnel and consider the following: a) the type of information and the classification level that the user endpoint devices can handle, process, store or support; b) registration of user endpoint devices; c) requirements for physical protection; d) restriction of software installation (e.g. remotely controlled by system administrators); e) requirements for user endpoint device software (including software versions) and for applying updates (e.g. active automatic updating); f) rules for connection to information services, public networks or any other network off premises (e.g. requiring the use of personal firewall); g) access controls; h) storage device encryption; i) protection against malware; j) remote disabling, deletion or lockout; k) backups; l) usage of web services and web applications; m) end user behavior analytics (see 8.16); n) the use of removable devices, including removable memory devices, and the possibility of disabling physical ports (e.g. USB ports); o) the use of partitioning capabilities, if supported by the user endpoint device, which can securely separate the organization's information and other associated assets (e.g. software) from other information and other associated assets on the device. Consideration should be given as to whether certain information is so sensitive that it can only be accessed via user endpoint devices, but not stored on such devices. In such cases, additional technical safeguards can be required on the device. For example, ensuring that downloading files for offline working is disabled and that local storage such as SD card is disabled. As far as possible, the recommendations on this control should be enforced through configuration management (see 8.9) or automated tools. User responsibility All users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting user endpoint devices, as well as of their responsibilities for implementing such security measures. Users should be advised to: a) log-off active sessions and terminate services when no longer needed; b) protect user endpoint devices from unauthorized use with a physical control (e.g. key lock or special locks) and logical control (e.g. password access) when not in use; not leave devices carrying important, sensitive or critical business information unattended; c) use devices with special care in public places, open offices, meeting places and other unprotected areas (e.g. avoid reading confidential information if people can read from the back, use privacy screen filters); d) physically protect user endpoint devices against theft (e.g. in cars and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centers and meeting places). A specific procedure taking into account legal, statutory, regulatory, contractual (including insurance) and other security requirements of the organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of user endpoint devices. Use of personal devices Where the organization allows the use of personal devices (sometimes known as BYOD), in addition to the guidance given in this control, the following should be considered: a) separation of personal and business use of the devices, including using software to support such separation and protect business data on a private device; b) providing access to business information only after users have acknowledged their duties (physical protection, software updating, etc.), waiving ownership of business data, allowing remote wiping of data by the organization in case of theft or loss of the device or when no longer authorized to use the service. In such cases, PII protection legislation should be considered; c) topic-specific policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property developed on privately owned equipment; d) access to privately owned equipment (to verify the security of the machine or during an investigation), which can be prevented by legislation; e) software licensing agreements that are such that organizations can become liable for licensing for client software on user endpoint devices owned privately by personnel or external party users. Wireless connections The organization should establish procedures for: a) the configuration of wireless connections on devices (e.g. disabling vulnerable protocols); b) using wireless or wired connections with appropriate bandwidth in accordance with relevant topic-specific policies (e.g. because backups or software updates are needed).","Controls to protect information on user endpoint devices depend on whether the user endpoint device is used only inside of the organization's secured premises and network connections, or whether it is exposed to increased physical and network related threats outside of the organization. The wireless connections for user endpoint devices are similar to other types of network connections but have important differences that should be considered when identifying controls. In particular, back-up of information stored on user endpoint devices can sometimes fail because of limited network bandwidth or because user endpoint devices are not connected at the times when backups are scheduled. For some USB ports, such as USB-C, disabling the USB port is not possible because it is used for other purposes (e.g. power delivery and display output).",Preventive,Protect

The following should be considered: a) identifying users who need privileged access rights for each system or process (e.g. operating systems, database management systems and applications); b) allocating privileged access rights to users as needed and on an event-by-event basis in line with the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15) (i.e. only to individuals with the necessary competence to carry out activities that require privileged access and based on the minimum requirement for their functional roles); c) maintaining an authorization process (i.e. determining who can approve privileged access rights, or not granting privileged access rights until the authorization process is complete) and a record of all privileges allocated; d) defining and implementing requirements for expiry of privileged access rights; e) taking measures to ensure that users are aware of their privileged access rights and when they are in privileged access mode. Possible measures include using specific user identities, user interface settings or even specific equipment; f) authentication requirements for privileged access rights can be higher than the requirements for normal access rights. Re-authentication or authentication step-up can be necessary before doing work with privileged access rights; g) regularly, and after any organizational change, reviewing users working with privileged access rights in order to verify if their duties, roles, responsibilities and competence still qualify them for working with privileged access rights (see 5.18); h) establishing specific rules in order to avoid the use of generic administration user IDs (such as “root”), depending on systems’ configuration capabilities. Managing and protecting authentication information of such identities (see 5.17); i) granting temporary privileged access just for the time window necessary to implement approved changes or activities (e.g. for maintenance activities or some critical changes), rather than permanently granting privileged access rights. This is often referred as break glass procedure, and often automated by privilege access management technologies; j) logging all privileged access to systems for audit purposes; k) not sharing or linking identities with privileged access rights to multiple persons, assigning each person a separate identity which allows assigning specific privileged access rights. Identities can be grouped (e.g. by defining an administrator group) in order to simplify the management of privileged access rights; l) only using identities with privileged access rights for undertaking administrative tasks and not for day-to-day general tasks [i.e. checking email, accessing the web (users should have a separate normal network identity for these activities)].","Privileged access rights are access rights provided to an identity, a role or a process that allows the performance of activities that typical users or processes cannot perform. System administrator roles typically require privileged access rights. Inappropriate use of system administrator privileges (any feature or facility of an information system that enables the user to override system or application controls) is a major contributory factor to failures or breaches of systems.

A.8.3,8.3,Technological controls,Information access restriction,Access to information and other associated assets shall be restricted in accordance with the established topic-specific policy on access control.,To ensure only authorized access and to prevent unauthorized access to information and other associated assets.,"Access to information and other associated assets should be restricted in accordance with the established topic-specific policies. The following should be considered in order to support access restriction requirements: a) not allowing access to sensitive information by unknown user identities or anonymously. Public or anonymous access should only be granted to storage locations that do not contain any sensitive information; b) providing configuration mechanisms to control access to information in systems, applications and services; c) controlling which data can be accessed by a particular user; d) controlling which identities or group of identities have which access, such as read, write, delete and execute; e) providing physical or logical access controls for the isolation of sensitive applications, application data, or systems. Further, dynamic access management techniques and processes to protect sensitive information that has high value to the organization should be considered when the organization: a) needs granular control over who can access such information during what period and in what way; b) wants to share such information with people outside the organization and maintain control over who can access it; c) wants to dynamically manage, in real-time, the use and distribution of such information; d) wants to protect such information against unauthorized changes, copying and distribution (including printing); e) wants to monitor the use of the information; f) wants to record any changes to such information that take place in case a future investigation is required. Dynamic access management techniques should protect information throughout its life cycle (i.e. creation, processing, storage, transmission and disposal), including: a) establishing rules on the management of dynamic access based on specific use cases considering: 1) granting access permissions based on identity, device, location or application; 2) leveraging the classification scheme in order to determine what information needs to be protected with dynamic access management techniques; b) establishing operational, monitoring and reporting processes and supporting technical infrastructure. Dynamic access management systems should protect information by: a) requiring authentication, appropriate credentials or a certificate to access information; b) restricting access, for example to a specified time frame (e.g. after a given date or until a particular date); c) using encryption to protect information; d) defining the printing permissions for the information; e) recording who accesses the information and how the information is used; f) raising alerts if attempts to misuse the information are detected.","Dynamic access management techniques and other dynamic information protection technologies can support the protection of information even when data is shared beyond the originating organization, where traditional access controls cannot be enforced. It can be applied to documents, emails or other files containing information to limit who can access the content and in what way. It can be at a granular level and be adapted over the life cycle of the information. Dynamic access management techniques do not replace classical access management [e.g. using access control lists (ACLs)], but can add more factors for conditionality, real-time evaluation, just-in-time data reduction and other enhancements that can be useful for the most sensitive information. It offers a way to control access outside the organization’s environment. Incident response can be supported by dynamic access management techniques as permissions can be modified or revoked at any time.

A.8.4,8.4,Technological controls,Access to source code,"Read and write access to source code, development tools and software libraries shall be appropriately managed.","To prevent the introduction of unauthorized functionality, avoid unintentional or malicious changes and to maintain the confidentiality of valuable intellectual property.","Access to source code and associated items (such as designs, specifications, verification plans and validation plans) and development tools (e.g. compilers, builders, integration tools, test platforms and environments) should be strictly controlled. For source code, this can be achieved by controlling central storage of such code, preferably in source code management system. Read access and write access to source code can differ based on the personnel’s role. For example, read access to source code can be broadly provided inside the organization, but write access to source code is only made available to privileged personnel or designated owners. Where code components are used by several developers within an organization, read access to a centralized code repository should be implemented. Furthermore, if open-source code or third-party code components are used inside an organization, read access to such external code repositories can be broadly provided. However, write access should still be restricted. The following guidelines should be considered to control access to program source libraries in order to reduce the potential for corruption of computer programs: a) managing the access to program source code and the program source libraries according to established procedures; b) granting read and write access to source code based on business needs and managed to address risks of alteration or misuse and according to established procedures; c) updating of source code and associated items and granting of access to source code in accordance with change control procedures (see 8.32) and only performing it after appropriate authorization has been received; d) not granting developers direct access to the source code repository, but through developer tools that control activities and authorizations on the source code; e) holding program listings in a secure environment, where read and write access should be appropriately managed and assigned; f) maintaining an audit log of all accesses and of all changes to source code. If the program source code is intended to be published, additional controls to provide assurance on its integrity (e.g. digital signature) should be considered.","If access to source code is not properly controlled, source code can be modified or some data in the development environment (e.g. copies of production data, configuration details) can be retrieved by unauthorized persons.",Preventive,Protect
A.8.5,8.5,Technological controls,Secure authentication,Secure authentication technologies and procedures shall be implemented based on information access restrictions and the topic-specific policy on access control.,"To ensure a user or an entity is securely authenticated, when access to systems, applications and services is granted.","A suitable authentication technique should be chosen to substantiate the claimed identity of a user, software, messages and other entities. The strength of authentication should be appropriate for the classification of the information to be accessed. Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methods alternative to passwords, such as digital certificates, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should be used. Authentication information should be accompanied by additional authentication factors for accessing critical information systems (also known as multi-factor authentication). Using a combination of multiple authentication factors, such as what you know, what you have and what you are, reduces the possibilities for unauthorized accesses. Multi-factor authentication can be combined with other techniques to require additional factors under specific circumstances, based on predefined rules and patterns, such as access from an unusual location, from an unusual device or at an unusual time. Biometric authentication information should be invalidated if it is ever compromised. Biometric authentication can be unavailable depending on the conditions of use (e.g. moisture or aging). To prepare for these issues, biometric authentication should be accompanied with at least one alternative authentication technique. The procedure for logging into a system or application should be designed to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Log-on procedures and technologies should be implemented considering the following: a) not displaying sensitive system or application information until the log-on process has been successfully completed in order to avoid providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary assistance; b) displaying a general notice warning that the system or the application or the service should only be accessed by authorized users; c) not providing help messages during the log-on procedure that would aid an unauthorized user (e.g. if an error condition arises, the system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or incorrect); d) validating the log-on information only on completion of all input data; e) protecting against brute force log-on attempts on usernames and passwords [e.g. using completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA), requiring password reset after a predefined number of failed attempts or blocking the user after a maximum number of errors]; f) logging unsuccessful and successful attempts; g) raising a security event if a potential attempted or successful breach of log-on controls is detected (e.g. sending an alert to the user and the organization’s system administrators when a certain number of wrong password attempts has been reached); h) displaying or sending the following information on a separate channel on completion of a successful log-on: 1) date and time of the previous successful log-on; 2) details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on; i) not displaying a password in clear text when it is being entered; in some cases, it can be required to de-activate this functionality in order to facilitate user log-on (e.g. for accessibility reasons or to avoid blocking users because of repeated errors); j) not transmitting passwords in clear text over a network to avoid being captured by a network ""sniffer” program; k) terminating inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity, especially in high risk locations such as public or external areas outside the organization’s security management or on user endpoint devices; l) restricting connection duration times to provide additional security for high-risk applications and reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access.",Additional information on entity authentication assurance can be found is ISO/IEC 29115.,Preventive,Protect

System tuning and monitoring should be applied to ensure and, where necessary, improve the availability and efficiency of systems. The organization should perform stress-tests of systems and services to confirm that sufficient system capacity is available to meet peak performance requirements. Detective controls should be put in place to indicate problems in due time. Projections of future capacity requirements should take account of new business and system requirements and current and projected trends in the organization’s information processing capabilities. Particular attention should be paid to any resources with long procurement lead times or high costs. Therefore, managers, service or product owners should monitor the utilization of key system resources. Managers should use capacity information to identify and avoid potential resource limitations and dependency on key personnel which can present a threat to system security or services and plan appropriate action. Providing sufficient capacity can be achieved by increasing capacity or by reducing demand. The following should be considered to increase capacity: a) hiring new personnel; b) obtaining new facilities or space; c) acquiring more powerful processing systems, memory and storage; d) making use of cloud computing, which has inherent characteristics that directly address issues of capacity. Cloud computing has elasticity and scalability which enable on-demand rapid expansion and reduction in resources available to particular applications and services. The following should be considered to reduce demand on the organization’s resources: a) deletion of obsolete data (disk space); b) disposal of hardcopy records that have met their retention period (free up shelving space); c) decommissioning of applications, systems, databases or environments; d) optimizing batch processes and schedules; e) optimizing application code or database queries; f) denying or restricting bandwidth for resource-consuming services if these are not critical (e.g. video streaming).

Carrying out regular scans that include: 1) scanning any data received over networks or via any form of electronic storage media, for malware before use; 2) scanning email and instant messaging attachments and downloads for malware before use. Carrying out this scan at different places (e.g. at email servers, desktop computers) and when entering the network of the organization; 3) scanning webpages for malware when accessed; g) determining the placement and configuration of malware detection and repair tools based on risk assessment outcomes and considering: 1) defense in depth principles where they would be most effective. For example, this can lead to malware detection in a network gateway (in various application protocols such as email, file transfer and web) as well as user endpoint devices and servers; 2) the evasive techniques of attackers (e.g. the use of encrypted files) to deliver malware or the use of encryption protocols to transmit malware; h) taking care to protect against the introduction of malware during maintenance and emergency procedures, which can bypass normal controls against malware; i) implementing a process to authorize temporarily or permanently disable some or all measures against malware, including exception approval authorities, documented justification and review date. This can be necessary when the protection against malware causes disruption to normal operations; j) preparing appropriate business continuity plans for recovering from malware attacks, including all necessary data and software backup (including both online and offline backup) and recovery measures (see 8.13); k) isolating environments where catastrophic consequences can occur; l) defining procedures and responsibilities to deal with protection against malware on systems, including training in their use, reporting and recovering from malware attacks; m) providing awareness or training (see 6.3) to all users on how to identify and potentially mitigate the receipt, sending or installation of malware infected emails, files or programs [the information collected in n) and o) can be used to ensure awareness and training are kept up-to-date]; n) implementing procedures to regularly collect information about new malware, such as subscribing to mailing lists or reviewing relevant websites; o) verifying that information relating to malware, such as warning bulletins, comes from qualified and reputable sources (e.g. reliable internet sites or suppliers of malware detection software) and is accurate and informative.",It is not always possible to install software that protects against malware on some systems (e.g. some industrial control systems).

A.8.8,8.8,Technological controls,Management of technical vulnerabilities,"Information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems in use shall be obtained, the organization’s exposure to such vulnerabilities shall be evaluated and appropriate measures shall be taken.",To prevent exploitation of technical vulnerabilities.,"Identifying technical vulnerabilities The organization should have an accurate inventory of assets (see 5.9 to 5.14) as a prerequisite for effective technical vulnerability management; the inventory should include the software vendor, software name, version numbers, current state of deployment (e.g. what software is installed on what systems) and the person(s) within the organization responsible for the software. To identify technical vulnerabilities, the organization should consider: a) defining and establishing the roles and responsibilities associated with technical vulnerability management, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment, updating, asset tracking and any coordination responsibilities required; b) for software and other technologies (based on the asset inventory list, see 5.9), identifying information resources that will be used for identifying relevant technical vulnerabilities and maintaining awareness about them. Updating the list of information resources based on changes in the inventory or when other new or useful resources are found; c) requiring suppliers of information system (including their components) to ensure vulnerability reporting, handling and disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see 5.20); d) using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in use to identify vulnerabilities and to verify whether the patching of vulnerabilities was successful; e) conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or vulnerability assessments by competent and authorized persons to support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising caution as such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the system; f) tracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for vulnerabilities. This should be included in secure coding (see 8.28). The organization should develop procedures and capabilities to: a) detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services including any external component used in these; b) receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources. The organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a topic-specific policy on vulnerability disclosure so that researchers and others are able to report issues. The organization should establish vulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms and making use of appropriate threat intelligence or information sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty programs where rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in identifying vulnerabilities in order to appropriately remediate them. The organization should also share information with competent industry bodies or other interested parties. Evaluating technical vulnerabilities To evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following guidance should be considered: a) analyze and verify reports to determine what response and remediation activity is needed; b) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, identifying the associated risks and the actions to be taken. Such actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other controls. Taking appropriate measures to address technical vulnerabilities A software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a designated copy. All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades. If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body. The following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities: a) taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical vulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities; b) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action according to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 5.26); c) only using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization); d) testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks associated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the update)]; e) addressing systems at high risk first; f) develop remediation (typically software updates or patches); g) test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective; h) provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation; i) if no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as: 1) applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources; 2) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability; 3) adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22); 4) shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of suitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching); 5) increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks; 6) raising awareness of the vulnerability. For acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their software and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide whether to use the automatic update or not. Other considerations An audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management. The technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency. An effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management activities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide technical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs. Where the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical vulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service provider. The cloud service provider’s responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should be part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service provider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are respective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example, the cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the cloud services.","Technical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32). There is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side effects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been applied. If adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in updating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other users. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial. Where software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an automated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can allow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of the installation of the update. Where the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the automated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over when the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated until the operation has completed. A weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defense in depth: two countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked by strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability scanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care in reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports. Many organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization but also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems, products and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users. Organizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically through a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database services. For more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud computing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017. ISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing vulnerability advisories. ISO/IEC 30111 provides detailed information about handling and resolving reported vulnerabilities.",Preventive,"Identify,Protect"

Roles, responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control of all configuration changes. Standard templates Standard templates for the secure configuration of hardware, software, services and networks should be defined: a) using publicly available guidance (e.g. pre-defined templates from vendors and from independent security organizations); b) considering the level of protection needed in order to determine a sufficient level of security; c) supporting the organization’s information security policy, topic-specific policies, standards and other security requirements; d) considering the feasibility and applicability of security configurations in the organization’s context. The templates should be reviewed periodically and updated when new threats or vulnerabilities need to be addressed, or when new software or hardware versions are introduced. The following should be considered for establishing standard templates for the secure configuration of hardware, software, services and networks: a) minimizing the number of identities with privileged or administrator level access rights; b) disabling unnecessary, unused or insecure identities; c) disabling or restricting unnecessary functions and services; d) restricting access to powerful utility programs and host parameter settings; e) synchronizing clocks; f) changing vendor default authentication information such as default passwords immediately after installation and reviewing other important default security-related parameters; g) invoking time-out facilities that automatically log off computing devices after a predetermined period of inactivity; h) verifying that license requirements have been met (see 5.32). Managing configurations Established configurations of hardware, software, services and networks should be recorded and a log should be maintained of all configuration changes. These records should be securely stored. This can be achieved in various ways, such as configuration databases or configuration templates. Changes to configurations should follow the change management process (see 8.32). Configuration records can contain as relevant: a) up-to-date owner or point of contact information for the asset; b) date of the last change of configuration; c) version of configuration template; d) relation to configurations of other assets. Monitoring configurations Configurations should be monitored with a comprehensive set of system management tools (e.g. maintenance utilities, remote support, enterprise management tools, backup and restore software) and should be reviewed on a regular basis to verify configuration settings, evaluate password strengths and assess activities performed. Actual configurations can be compared with the defined target templates. Any deviations should be addressed, either by automatic enforcement of the defined target configuration or by manual analysis of the deviation followed by corrective actions.",Documentation for systems often records details about the configuration of both hardware and software. System hardening is a typical part of configuration management. Configuration management can be integrated with asset management processes and associated tooling. Automation is usually more effective to manage security configuration (e.g. using infrastructure as code). Configuration templates and targets can be confidential information and should be protected from unauthorized access accordingly.,Preventive,Protect
A.8.10,8.10,Technological controls,Information deletion,"Information stored in information systems, devices or in any other storage media shall be deleted when no longer required.","To prevent unnecessary exposure of sensitive information and to comply with legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements for information deletion.","General Sensitive information should not be kept for longer than it is required to reduce the risk of undesirable disclosure. When deleting information on systems, applications and services, the following should be considered: a) selecting a deletion method (e.g. electronic overwriting or cryptographic erasure) in accordance with business requirements and taking into consideration relevant laws and regulations; b) recording the results of deletion as evidence; c) when using service suppliers of information deletion, obtaining evidence of information deletion from them. Where third parties store the organization’s information on its behalf, the organization should consider the inclusion of requirements on information deletion into the third-party agreements to enforce it during and upon termination of such services. Deletion methods In accordance with the organization’s topic-specific policy on data retention and taking into consideration relevant legislation and regulations, sensitive information should be deleted when no longer required, by: a) configuring systems to securely destroy information when no longer required (e.g. after a defined period subject to the topic-specific policy on data retention or by subject access request); b) deleting obsolete versions, copies and temporary files wherever they are located; c) using approved, secure deletion software to permanently delete information to help ensure information cannot be recovered by using specialist recovery or forensic tools; d) using approved, certified providers of secure disposal services; e) using disposal mechanisms appropriate for the type of storage media being disposed of (e.g. degaussing hard disk drives and other magnetic storage media). Where cloud services are used, the organization should verify if the deletion method provided by the cloud service provider is acceptable, and if it is the case, the organization should use it, or request that the cloud service provider delete the information. These deletion processes should be automated in accordance with topic-specific policies, when available and applicable. Depending on the sensitivity of information deleted, logs can track or verify that these deletion processes have happened. To avoid the unintentional exposure of sensitive information when equipment is being sent back to vendors, sensitive information should be protected by removing auxiliary storages (e.g. hard disk drives) and memory before equipment leaves the organization’s premises. Considering that the secure deletion of some devices (e.g. smartphones) can only be achieved through destruction or using the functions embedded in these devices (e.g. “restore factory settings”), the organization should choose the appropriate method according to the classification of information handled by such devices. Control measures described in 7.14 should be applied to physically destroy the storage device and simultaneously delete the information it contains. An official record of information deletion is useful when analyzing the cause of a possible information leakage event.",Information on user data deletion in cloud services can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.

A.8.11,8.11,Technological controls,Data masking,"Data masking shall be used in accordance with the organization’s topic-specific policy on access control and other related topic-specific policies, and business requirements, taking applicable legislation into consideration.","To limit the exposure of sensitive data including PII, and to comply with legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements.","Where the protection of sensitive data (e.g. PII) is a concern, the organization should consider hiding such data by using techniques such as data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization. Pseudonymization or anonymization techniques can hide PII, disguise the true identity of PII principals or other sensitive information, and disconnect the link between PII and the identity of the PII principal or the link between other sensitive information. When using pseudonymization or anonymization techniques, it should be verified that data has been adequately pseudonymized or anonymized. Data anonymization should consider all the elements of the sensitive information to be effective. As an example, if not considered properly, a person can be identified even if the data that can directly identify that person is anonymized, by the presence of further data which allows the person to be identified indirectly. Additional techniques for data masking include: a) encryption (requiring authorized users to have a key); b) nulling or deleting characters (preventing unauthorized users from seeing full messages); c) varying numbers and dates; d) substitution (changing one value for another to hide sensitive data); e) replacing values with their hash. The following should be considered when implementing data masking techniques: a) not granting all users access to all data, therefore designing queries and masks in order to show only the minimum required data to the user; b) there are cases where some data should not be visible to the user for some records out of a set of data; in this case, designing and implementing a mechanism for obfuscation of data (e.g. if a patient does not want hospital staff to be able to see all of their records, even in case of emergency, then the hospital staff are presented with partially obfuscated data and data can only be accessed by staff with specific roles if it contains useful information for appropriate treatment); c) when data are obfuscated, giving the PII principal the possibility to require that users cannot see if the data are obfuscated (obfuscation of the obfuscation; this is used in health facilities, for example if the patient does not want personnel to see that sensitive information such as pregnancies or results of blood exams has been obfuscated); d) any legal or regulatory requirements (e.g. requiring the masking of payment cards' information during processing or storage). The following should be considered when using data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization: a) level of strength of data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization according to the usage of the processed data; b) access controls to the processed data; c) agreements or restrictions on usage of the processed data; d) prohibiting collating the processed data with other information in order to identify the PII principal; e) keeping track of providing and receiving the processed data.","Anonymization irreversibly alters PII in such a way that the PII principal can no longer be identified directly or indirectly. Pseudonymization replaces the identifying information with an alias. Knowledge of the algorithm (sometimes referred to as the “additional information”) used to perform the pseudonymization allows for at least some form of identification of the PII principal. Such “additional information” should therefore be kept separate and protected. While pseudonymization is therefore weaker than anonymization, pseudonymized datasets can be more useful in statistical research. Data masking is a set of techniques to conceal, substitute or obfuscate sensitive data items. Data masking can be static (when data items are masked in the original database), dynamic (using automation and rules to secure data in real-time) or on-the-fly (with data masked in an application’s memory). Hash functions can be used in order to anonymize PII. In order to prevent enumeration attacks, they should always be combined with a salt function. PII in resource identifiers and their attributes [e.g. file names, uniform resource locators (URLs)] should be either avoided or appropriately anonymized. Additional controls concerning the protection of PII in public clouds are given in ISO/IEC 27018. Additional information on de-identification techniques is available in ISO/IEC 20889.",Preventive,Protect
A.8.12,8.12,Technological controls,Data leakage prevention,"Data leakage prevention measures shall be applied to systems, networks and any other devices that process, store or transmit sensitive information.",To detect and prevent the unauthorized disclosure and extraction of information by individuals or systems.,"The organization should consider the following to reduce the risk of data leakage: a) identifying and classifying information to protect against leakage (e.g. personal information, pricing models and product designs); b) monitoring channels of data leakage (e.g. email, file transfers, mobile devices and portable storage devices); c) acting to prevent information from leaking (e.g. quarantine emails containing sensitive information). Data leakage prevention tools should be used to: a) identify and monitor sensitive information at risk of unauthorized disclosure (e.g. in unstructured data on a user’s system); b) detect the disclosure of sensitive information (e.g. when information is uploaded to untrusted third-party cloud services or sent via email); c) block user actions or network transmissions that expose sensitive information (e.g. preventing the copying of database entries into a spreadsheet). The organization should determine if it is necessary to restrict a user’s ability to copy and paste or upload data to services, devices and storage media outside of the organization. If that is the case, the organization should implement technology such as data leakage prevention tools or the configuration of existing tools that allow users to view and manipulate data held remotely but prevent copy and paste outside of the organization’s control. If data export is required, the data owner should be allowed to approve the export and hold users accountable for their actions. Taking screenshots or photographs of the screen should be addressed through terms and conditions of use, training and auditing. Where data is backed up, care should be taken to ensure sensitive information is protected using measures such as encryption, access control and physical protection of the storage media holding the backup. Data leakage prevention should also be considered to protect against the intelligence actions of an adversary from obtaining confidential or secret information (geopolitical, human, financial, commercial, scientific or any other) which can be of interest for espionage or can be critical for the community. The data leakage prevention actions should be oriented to confuse the adversary’s decisions for example by replacing authentic information with false information, either as an independent action or as response to the adversary’s intelligence actions. Examples of these kinds of actions are reverse social engineering or the use of honeypots to attract attackers.","Data leakage prevention tools are designed to identify data, monitor data usage and movement, and take actions to prevent data from leaking (e.g. alerting users to their risky behavior and blocking the transfer of data to portable storage devices). Data leakage prevention inherently involves monitoring personnel’s communications and online activities, and by extension external party messages, which raises legal concerns that should be considered prior to deploying data leakage prevention tools. There is a variety of legislation relating to privacy, data protection, employment, interception of data and telecommunications that is applicable to monitoring and data processing in the context of data leakage prevention. Data leakage prevention can be supported by standard security controls, such as topic-specific policies on access control and secure document management (see 5.12 and 5.15).","Preventive,Detective","Protect,Detect"
A.8.13,8.13,Technological controls,Information backup,"Backup copies of information, software and systems shall be maintained and regularly tested in accordance with the agreed topic-specific policy on backup.",To enable recovery from loss of data or systems.,"A topic-specific policy on backup should be established to address the organization’s data retention and information security requirements. Adequate backup facilities should be provided to ensure that all essential information and software can be recovered following an incident or failure or loss of storage media. Plans should be developed and implemented for how the organization will back up information, software and systems, to address the topic-specific policy on backup. When designing a backup plan, the following items should be taken into consideration: a) producing accurate and complete records of the backup copies and documented restoration procedures; b) reflecting the business requirements of the organization (e.g. the recovery point objective, see 5.30), the security requirements of the information involved and the criticality of the information to the continued operation of the organization in the extent (e.g. full or differential backup) and frequency of backups; c) storing the backups in a safe and secure remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any damage from a disaster at the main site; d) giving backup information an appropriate level of physical and environmental protection (see Clause 7 and 8.1) consistent with the standards applied at the main site; e) regularly testing backup media to ensure that they can be relied on for emergency use when necessary. Testing the ability to restore backed-up data onto a test system, not by overwriting the original storage media in case the backup or restoration process fails and causes irreparable data damage or loss; f) protecting backups by means of encryption according to the identified risks (e.g. in situations where confidentiality is of importance); g) taking care to ensure that inadvertent data loss is detected before backup is taken. Operational procedures should monitor the execution of backups and address failures of scheduled backups to ensure completeness of backups according to the topic-specific policy on backups. Backup measures for individual systems and services should be regularly tested to ensure that they meet the objectives of incident response and business continuity plans (see 5.30). This should be combined with a test of the restoration procedures and checked against the restoration time required by the business continuity plan. In the case of critical systems and services, backup measures should cover all systems information, applications and data necessary to recover the complete system in the event of a disaster. When the organization uses a cloud service, backup copies of the organization’s information, applications and systems in the cloud service environment should be taken. The organization should determine if and how requirements for backup are fulfilled when using the information backup service provided as part of the cloud service. The retention period for essential business information should be determined, taking into account any requirement for retention of archive copies. The organization should consider the deletion of information (see 8.10) in storage media used for backup once the information’s retention period expires and should take into consideration legislation and regulations.","For further information on storage security including retention consideration, see ISO/IEC 27040.",Corrective,Recover
A.8.14,8.14,Technological controls,Redundancy of information processing facilities,Information processing facilities shall be implemented with redundancy sufficient to meet availability requirements.,To ensure the continuous operation of information processing facilities.,"The organization should identify requirements for the availability of business services and information systems. The organization should design and implement systems architecture with appropriate redundancy to meet these requirements. Redundancy can be introduced by duplicating information processing facilities in part or in their entirety (i.e. spare components or having two of everything). The organization should plan and implement procedures for the activation of the redundant components and processing facilities. The procedures should establish if the redundant components and processing activities are always activated, or in case of emergency, automatically or manually activated. The redundant components and information processing facilities should ensure the same security level as the primary ones. Mechanisms should be in place to alert the organization to any failure in the information processing facilities, enable executing the planned procedure and allow continued availability while the information processing facilities are repaired or replaced. The organization should consider the following when implementing redundant systems: a) contracting with two or more suppliers of network and critical information processing facilities such as internet service providers; b) using redundant networks; c) using two geographically separate data centers with mirrored systems; d) using physically redundant power supplies or sources; e) using multiple parallel instances of software components, with automatic load balancing between them (between instances in the same data center or in different data centers); f) having duplicated components in systems (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memories) or in networks (e.g. firewalls, routers, switches). Where applicable, preferably in production mode, redundant information systems should be tested to ensure the failover from one component to another component works as intended.","There is a strong relationship between redundancy and ICT readiness for business continuity (see 5.30) especially if short recovery times are required. Many of the redundancy measures can be part of the ICT continuity strategies and solutions. The implementation of redundancies can introduce risks to the integrity (e.g. processes of copying data to duplicated components can introduce errors) or confidentiality (e.g. weak security control of duplicated components can lead to compromise) of information and information systems, which need to be considered when designing information systems. Redundancy in information processing facilities does not usually address application unavailability due to faults within an application. With the use of public cloud computing, it is possible to have multiple live versions of information processing facilities, existing in multiple separate physical locations with automatic failover and load balancing between them. Some of the technologies and techniques for providing redundancy and automatic fail-over in the context of cloud services are discussed in ISO/IEC TS 23167.",Preventive,Protect
A.8.15,8.15,Technological controls,Logging,"Logs that record activities, exceptions, faults and other relevant events shall be produced, stored, protected and analysed.","To record events, generate evidence, ensure the integrity of log information, prevent against unauthorized access, identify information security events that can lead to an information security incident and to support investigations.","General The organization should determine the purpose for which logs are created, what data is collected and logged, and any log-specific requirements for protecting and handling the log data. This should be documented in a topic-specific policy on logging. Event logs should include for each event, as applicable: a) user IDs; b) system activities; c) dates, times and details of relevant events (e.g. log-on and log-off); d) device identity, system identifier and location; e) network addresses and protocols. The following events should be considered for logging: a) successful and rejected system access attempts; b) successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts; c) changes to system configuration; d) use of privileges; e) use of utility programs and applications; f) files accessed and the type of access, including deletion of important data files; g) alarms raised by the access control system; h) activation and de-activation of security systems, such as anti-virus systems and intrusion detection systems; i) creation, modification or deletion of identities; j) transactions executed by users in applications. In some cases, the applications are a service or product provided or run by a third party. It is important for all systems to have synchronized time sources (see 8.17) as this allows for correlation of logs between systems for analysis, alerting and investigation of an incident. Protection of logs Users, including those with privileged access rights, should not have permission to delete or de-activate logs of their own activities. They can potentially manipulate the logs on information processing facilities under their direct control. Therefore, it is necessary to protect and review the logs to maintain accountability for the privileged users. Controls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes to log information and operational problems with the logging facility including: a) alterations to the message types that are recorded; b) log files being edited or deleted; c) failure to record events or over-writing of past recorded events if the storage media holding a log file is exceeded. For protection of logs, the use of the following techniques should be considered: cryptographic hashing, recording in an append-only and read-only file, recording in a public transparency file. Some audit logs can be required to be archived because of requirements on data retention or requirements to collect and retain evidence (see 5.28). Where the organization needs to send system or application logs to a vendor to assist with debugging or troubleshooting errors, logs should be de-identified where possible using data masking techniques (see 8.11) for information such as usernames, internet protocol (IP) addresses, hostnames or organization name, before sending to the vendor. Event logs can contain sensitive data and personally identifiable information. Appropriate privacy protection measures should be taken (see 5.34). Log analysis Log analysis should cover the analysis and interpretation of information security events, to help identify unusual activity or anomalous behavior, which can represent indicators of compromise. Analysis of events should be performed by taking into account: a) the necessary skills for the experts performing the analysis; b) determining the procedure of log analysis; c) the required attributes of each security-related event; d) exceptions identified through the use of predetermined rules [e.g. security information and event management (SIEM) or firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) or malware signatures]; e) known behavior patterns and standard network traffic compared to anomalous activity and behavior [user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)]; f) results of trend or pattern analysis (e.g. as a result of using data analytics, big data techniques and specialized analysis tools); g) available threat intelligence. Log analysis should be supported by specific monitoring activities to help identify and analyze anomalous behavior, which includes: a) reviewing successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources [e.g. domain name system (DNS) servers, web portals and file shares]; b) checking DNS logs to identify outbound network connections to malicious servers, such as those associated with botnet command and control servers; c) examining usage reports from service providers (e.g. invoices or service reports) for unusual activity within systems and networks (e.g. by reviewing patterns of activity); d) including event logs of physical monitoring such as entrance and exit to ensure more accurate detection and incident analysis; e) correlating logs to enable efficient and highly accurate analysis. Suspected and actual information security incidents should be identified (e.g. malware infection or probing of firewalls) and be subject to further investigation (e.g. as part of an information security incident management process, see 5.25).","System logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which is extraneous to information security monitoring. To help identify significant events for information security monitoring purposes, the use of suitable utility programs or audit tools to perform file interrogation can be considered. Event logging sets the foundation for automated monitoring systems (see 8.16) which are capable of generating consolidated reports and alerts on system security. A SIEM tool or equivalent service can be used to store, correlate, normalize and analyze log information, and to generate alerts. SIEMs tend to require careful configuration to optimize their benefits. Configurations to consider include identification and selection of appropriate log sources, tuning and testing of rules and development of use cases. Public transparency files for the recording of logs are used, for example, in certificate transparency systems. Such files can provide an additional detection mechanism useful for guarding against log tampering. In cloud environments, log management responsibilities can be shared between the cloud service customer and the cloud service provider. Responsibilities vary depending on the type of cloud service being used. Further guidance can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.",Detective,Detect
A.8.16,8.16,Technological controls,Monitoring activities,"Networks, systems and applications shall be monitored for anomalous behaviour and appropriate actions taken to evaluate potential information security incidents.",To detect anomalous behavior and potential information security incidents.,"The monitoring scope and level should be determined in accordance with business and information security requirements and taking into consideration relevant laws and regulations. Monitoring records should be maintained for defined retention periods. The following should be considered for inclusion within the monitoring system: a) outbound and inbound network, system and application traffic; b) access to systems, servers, networking equipment, monitoring system, critical applications, etc.; c) critical or admin level system and network configuration files; d) logs from security tools [e.g. antivirus, IDS, intrusion prevention system (IPS), web filters, firewalls, data leakage prevention]; e) event logs relating to system and network activity; f) checking that the code being executed is authorized to run in the system and that it has not been tampered with (e.g. by recompilation to add additional unwanted code); g) use of the resources (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memory, bandwidth) and their performance. The organization should establish a baseline of normal behavior and monitor against this baseline for anomalies. When establishing a baseline, the following should be considered: a) reviewing utilization of systems at normal and peak periods; b) usual time of access, location of access, frequency of access for each user or group of users. The monitoring system should be configured against the established baseline to identify anomalous behavior, such as: a) unplanned termination of processes or applications; b) activity typically associated with malware or traffic originating from known malicious IP addresses or network domains (e.g. those associated with botnet command and control servers); c) known attack characteristics (e.g. denial of service and buffer overflows); d) unusual system behavior (e.g. keystroke logging, process injection and deviations in use of standard protocols); e) bottlenecks and overloads (e.g. network queuing, latency levels and network jitter); f) unauthorized access (actual or attempted) to systems or information; g) unauthorized scanning of business applications, systems and networks; h) successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources (e.g. DNS servers, web portals and file systems); i) unusual user and system behavior in relation to expected behavior. Continuous monitoring via a monitoring tool should be used. Monitoring should be done in real time or in periodic intervals, subject to organizational need and capabilities. Monitoring tools should include the ability to handle large amounts of data, adapt to a constantly changing threat landscape, and allow for real-time notification. The tools should also be able to recognize specific signatures and data or network or application behavior patterns. Automated monitoring software should be configured to generate alerts (e.g. via management consoles, email messages or instant messaging systems) based on predefined thresholds. The alerting system should be tuned and trained on the organization’s baseline to minimize false positives. Personnel should be dedicated to respond to alerts and should be properly trained to accurately interpret potential incidents. There should be redundant systems and processes in place to receive and respond to alert notifications. Abnormal events should be communicated to relevant parties in order to improve the following activities: auditing, security evaluation, vulnerability scanning and monitoring (see 5.25). Procedures should be in place to respond to positive indicators from the monitoring system in a timely manner, in order to minimize the effect of adverse events (see 5.26) on information security. Procedures should also be established to identify and address false positives including tuning the monitoring software to reduce the number of future false positives.","Security monitoring can be enhanced by: a) leveraging threat intelligence systems (see 5.7); b) leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities; c) using blocklists or allowlists; d) undertaking a range of technical security assessments (e.g. vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, cyber-attack simulations and cyber response exercises), and using the results of these assessments to help determine baselines or acceptable behavior; e) using performance monitoring systems to help establish and detect anomalous behavior; f) leveraging logs in combination with monitoring systems. Monitoring activities are often conducted using specialist software, such as intrusion detection systems. These can be configured to a baseline of normal, acceptable and expected system and network activities. Monitoring for anomalous communications helps in the identification of botnets (i.e. set of devices under the malicious control of the botnet owner, usually used for mounting distributed denial of service attacks on other computers of other organizations). If the computer is being controlled by an external device, there is a communication between the infected device and the controller. The organization should therefore employ technologies to monitor for anomalous communications and take such action as necessary.","Detective,Corrective","Detect,Respond"

Such requirements can be from legal, statutory, regulatory, contractual, standards and internal monitoring needs. A standard reference time for use within the organization should be defined and considered for all systems, including building management systems, entry and exit systems and others that can be used to aid investigations. A clock linked to a radio time broadcast from a national atomic clock or global positioning system (GPS) should be used as the reference clock for logging systems; a consistent, trusted date and time source to ensure accurate time-stamps. Protocols such as network time protocol (NTP) or precision time protocol (PTP) should be used to keep all networked systems in synchronization with a reference clock. The organization can use two external time sources at the same time in order to improve the reliability of external clocks, and appropriately manage any variance. Clock synchronization can be difficult when using multiple cloud services or when using both cloud and on-premises services. In this case, the clock of each service should be monitored and the difference recorded in order to mitigate risks arising from discrepancies.","The correct setting of computer clocks is important to ensure the accuracy of event logs, which can be required for investigations or as evidence in legal and disciplinary cases.

Any decision to upgrade to a new release should take into account the business requirements for the change and the security of the release (e.g. the introduction of new information security functionality or the number and severity of information security vulnerabilities affecting the current version). Software patches should be applied when they can help to remove or reduce information security vulnerabilities (see 8.8 and 8.19). Computer software can rely on externally supplied software and packages (e.g. software programs using modules which are hosted on external sites), which should be monitored and controlled to avoid unauthorized changes, because they can introduce information security vulnerabilities. Vendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported by the supplier. Over time, software vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The organization should consider the risks of relying on unsupported software. Open source software used in operational systems should be maintained to the latest appropriate release of the software. Over time, open source code can cease to be maintained but is still available in an open source software repository. The organization should also consider risks of relying on unmaintained open source software when used in operational systems. When suppliers are involved in installing or updating software, physical or logical access should only be given when necessary and with appropriate authorization. The supplier’s activities should be monitored (see 5.22). The organization should define and enforce strict rules on which types of software users can install. The principle of least privilege should be applied to software installation on operational systems. The organization should identify what types of software installations are permitted (e.g. updates and security patches to existing software) and what types of installations are prohibited (e.g. software that is only for personal use and software whose pedigree with regard to being potentially malicious is unknown or suspect). These privileges should be granted based on the roles of the users concerned.",No other information.,Preventive,Protect

Additional controls can also be required to maintain the availability of the network services and computers connected to the network; f) appropriately logging and monitoring to enable recording and detection of actions that can affect, or are relevant to, information security (see 8.16 and 8.15); g) closely coordinating network management activities both to optimize the service to the organization and to ensure that controls are consistently applied across the information processing infrastructure; h) authenticating systems on the network; i) restricting and filtering systems connection to the network (e.g. using firewalls); j) detecting, restricting and authenticating the connection of equipment and devices to the network; k) hardening of network devices; l) segregating network administration channels from other network traffic; m) temporarily isolating critical subnetworks (e.g. with drawbridges) if the network is under attack; n) disabling vulnerable network protocols. The organization should ensure that appropriate security controls are applied to the use of virtualized networks. Virtualized networks also cover software-defined networking (SDN, SD-WAN). Virtualized networks can be desirable from a security viewpoint, since they can permit logical separation of communication taking place over physical networks, particularly for systems and applications that are implemented using distributed computing.",Additional information on network security can be found in the ISO/IEC 27033 series.

The organization should ensure that network service providers implement these measures. The ability of the network service provider to manage agreed services in a secure way should be determined and regularly monitored. The right to audit should be agreed between the organization and the provider. The organization should also consider third-party attestations provided by service providers to demonstrate they maintain appropriate security measures. Rules on the use of networks and network services should be formulated and implemented to cover: a) the networks and network services which are allowed to be accessed; b) authentication requirements for accessing various network services; c) authorization procedures for determining who is allowed to access which networks and networked services; d) network management and technological controls and procedures to protect access to network connections and network services; e) the means used to access networks and network services [e.g. use of virtual private network (VPN) or wireless network]; f) time, location and other attributes of the user at the time of the access; g) monitoring of the use of network services. The following security features of network services should be considered: a) technology applied for security of network services, such as authentication, encryption and network connection controls; b) technical parameters required for secured connection with the network services in accordance with the security and network connection rules; c) caching (e.g. in a content delivery network) and its parameters that allow users to choose the use of caching in accordance with performance, availability and confidentiality requirements; d) procedures for the network service usage to restrict access to network services or applications, where necessary.","Network services include the provision of connections, private network services and managed network security solutions such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

A.8.22,8.22,Technological controls,Segregation of networks,"Groups of information services, users and information systems shall be segregated in the organization’s networks.",To split the network in security boundaries and to control traffic between them based on business needs.,"The organization should consider managing the security of large networks by dividing them into separate network domains and separating them from the public network (i.e. internet). The domains can be chosen based on levels of trust, criticality and sensitivity (e.g. public access domain, desktop domain, server domain, low- and high-risk systems), along organizational units (e.g. human resources, finance, marketing) or some combination (e.g. server domain connecting to multiple organizational units). The segregation can be done using either physically different networks or by using different logical networks. The perimeter of each domain should be well-defined. If access between network domains is allowed, it should be controlled at the perimeter using a gateway (e.g. firewall, filtering router). The criteria for segregation of networks into domains, and the access allowed through the gateways, should be based on an assessment of the security requirements of each domain. The assessment should be in accordance with the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15), access requirements, value and classification of information processed and take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable gateway technology. Wireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly-defined network perimeter. Radio coverage adjustment should be considered for segregation of wireless networks. For sensitive environments, consideration should be made to treat all wireless access as external connections and to segregate this access from internal networks until the access has passed through a gateway in accordance with network controls (see 8.20) before granting access to internal systems. Wireless access network for guests should be segregated from those for personnel if personnel only use controlled user endpoint devices compliant to the organization’s topic-specific policies. Wi-Fi for guests should have at least the same restrictions as Wi-Fi for personnel, in order to discourage the use of guest Wi-Fi by personnel.","Networks often extend beyond organizational boundaries, as business partnerships are formed that require the interconnection or sharing of information processing and networking facilities. Such extensions can increase the risk of unauthorized access to the organization’s information systems that use the network, some of which require protection from other network users because of their sensitivity or criticality.",Preventive,Protect

A technique for achieving this works by blocking the IP address or domain of the website(s) concerned. Some browsers and anti-malware technologies do this automatically or can be configured to do so. The organization should identify the types of websites to which personnel should or should not have access. The organization should consider blocking access to the following types of websites: a) websites that have an information upload function unless permitted for valid business reasons; b) known or suspected malicious websites (e.g. those distributing malware or phishing contents); c) command and control servers; d) malicious website acquired from threat intelligence (see 5.7); e) websites sharing illegal content. Prior to deploying this control, the organization should establish rules for safe and appropriate use of online resources, including any restriction to undesirable or inappropriate websites and web-based applications. The rules should be kept up-to-date. Training should be given to personnel on the secure and appropriate use of online resources including access to the web. The training should include the organization’s rules, contact point for raising security concerns, and exception process when restricted web resources need to be accessed for legitimate business reasons. Training should also be given to personnel to ensure that they do not overrule any browser advisory that reports that a website is not secure but allows the user to proceed.","Web filtering can include a range of techniques including signatures, heuristics, list of acceptable websites or domains, list of prohibited websites or domains and bespoke configuration to help prevent malicious software and other malicious activity from attacking the organization’s network and systems.",Preventive,Protect

A topic-specific policy on the use of cryptography is necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of using cryptographic techniques and to avoid inappropriate or incorrect use; b) identifying the required level of protection and the classification of the information and consequently establishing the type, strength and quality of the cryptographic algorithms required; c) the use of cryptography for protection of information held on mobile user endpoint devices or storage media and transmitted over networks to such devices or storage media; d) the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the generation and protection of cryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or damaged keys; e) roles and responsibilities for: 1) the implementation of the rules for the effective use of cryptography; 2) the key management, including key generation (see 8.24); f) the standards to be adopted, as well as cryptographic algorithms, cipher strength, cryptographic solutions and usage practices that are approved or required for use in the organization; g) the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely on content inspection (e.g. malware detection or content filtering). When implementing the organization’s rules for effective use of cryptography, the regulations and national restrictions that can apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world should be taken into consideration as well as the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information (see 5.31). The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic services (e.g. with a certification authority) should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response times for the provision of services (see 5.22). Key management Appropriate key management requires secure processes for generating, storing, archiving, retrieving, distributing, retiring and destroying cryptographic keys. A key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures and secure methods for: a) generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications; b) issuing and obtaining public key certificates; c) distributing keys to intended entities, including how to activate keys when received; d) storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys; e) changing or updating keys including rules on when to change keys and how this will be done; f) dealing with compromised keys; g) revoking keys including how to withdraw or deactivate keys [e.g. when keys have been compromised or when a user leaves an organization (in which case keys should also be archived)]; h) recovering keys that are lost or corrupted; i) backing up or archiving keys; j) destroying keys; k) logging and auditing of key management related activities; l) setting activation and deactivation dates for keys so that the keys can only be used for the period of time according to the organization's rules on key management; m) handling legal requests for access to cryptographic keys (e.g. encrypted information can be required to be made available in an unencrypted form as evidence in a court case). All cryptographic keys should be protected against modification and loss. In addition, secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized use as well as disclosure. Equipment used to generate, store and archive keys should be physically protected. In addition to integrity, for many use cases, the authenticity of public keys should also be considered.","The authenticity of public keys is usually addressed by public key management processes using certificate authorities and public key certificates, but it is also possible to address it by using technologies such as applying manual processes for small number keys. Cryptography can be used to achieve different information security objectives, for example: a) confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information, either stored or transmitted; b) integrity or authenticity: using digital signatures or message authentication codes to verify the authenticity or integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information. Using algorithms for the purpose of file integrity checking; c) non-repudiation: using cryptographic techniques to provide evidence of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or action; d) authentication: using cryptographic techniques to authenticate users and other system entities requesting access to or transacting with system users, entities and resources.

These requirements are usually determined through a risk assessment. The requirements should be developed with the support of information security specialists. Application security requirements can cover a wide range of topics, depending on the purpose of the application. Application security requirements should include, as applicable: a) level of trust in identity of entities [e.g. through authentication (see 5.17, 8.2 and 8.5)]; b) identifying the type of information and classification level to be processed by the application; c) need for segregation of access and level of access to data and functions in the application; d) resilience against malicious attacks or unintentional disruptions [e.g. protection against buffer overflow or structured query language (SQL) injections]; e) legal, statutory and regulatory requirements in the jurisdiction where the transaction is generated, processed, completed or stored; f) need for privacy associated with all parties involved; g) the protection requirements of any confidential information; h) protection of data while being processed, in transit and at rest; i) need to securely encrypt communications between all involved parties; j) input controls, including integrity checks and input validation; k) automated controls (e.g. approval limits or dual approvals); l) output controls, also considering who can access outputs and its authorization; m) restrictions around content of ""free-text"" fields, as these can lead to uncontrolled storage of confidential data (e.g. personal data); n) requirements derived from the business process, such as transaction logging and monitoring, nonrepudiation requirements; o) requirements mandated by other security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection systems); p) error message handling. Transactional services Additionally, for applications offering transactional services between the organization and a partner, the following should be considered when identifying information security requirements: a) the level of trust each party requires in each other’s claimed identity; b) the level of trust required in the integrity of information exchanged or processed and the mechanisms for identification of lack of integrity (e.g. cyclic redundancy check, hashing, digital signatures); c) authorization processes associated with who can approve contents of, issue or sign key transactional documents; d) confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and receipt of key documents and the non-repudiation (e.g. contracts associated with tendering and contract processes); e) the confidentiality and integrity of any transactions (e.g. orders, delivery address details and confirmation of receipts); f) requirements on how long to maintain a transaction confidential; g) insurance and other contractual requirements. Electronic ordering and payment applications Additionally, for applications involving electronic ordering and payment, the following should be considered: a) requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of order information; b) the degree of verification appropriate to verify payment information supplied by a customer; c) avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information; d) storing transaction details outside of any publicly accessible environment (e.g. on a storage platform existing on the organizational intranet, and not retained and exposed on electronic storage media directly accessible from the internet); e) where a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purposes of issuing and maintaining digital signatures or digital certificates) security is integrated and embedded throughout the entire end to- end certificate or signature management process. Several of the above considerations can be addressed by the application of cryptography (see 8.24), taking into consideration legal requirements (see 5.31 to 5.36, especially see 5.31 for cryptography legislation).","Applications accessible via networks are subject to a range of network related threats, such as fraudulent activities, contract disputes or disclosure of information to the public; incomplete transmission, misrouting, unauthorized message alteration, duplication or replay.

Security should be designed into all architecture layers (business, data, applications and technology). New technology should be analyzed for security risks and the design should be reviewed against known attack patterns. Secure engineering principles provide guidance on user authentication techniques, secure session control and data validation and sanitization. Secure system engineering principles should include analysis of: a) the full range of security controls required to protect information and systems against identified threats; b) the capabilities of security controls to prevent, detect or respond to security events; c) specific security controls required by particular business processes (e.g. encryption of sensitive information, integrity checking and digitally signing information); d) where and how security controls are to be applied (e.g. by integrating with a security architecture and the technical infrastructure); e) how individual security controls (manual and automated) work together to produce an integrated set of controls. Security engineering principles should take account of: a) the need to integrate with a security architecture; b) technical security infrastructure [e.g. public key infrastructure (PKI), identity and access management (IAM), data leakage prevention and dynamic access management]; c) capability of the organization to develop and support the chosen technology; d) cost, time and complexity of meeting security requirements; e) current good practices. Secure system engineering should involve: a) the use of security architecture principles, such as “security by design”, “defense in depth”, “security by default”, “default deny”, “fail securely”, “distrust input from external applications”, “security in deployment”, “assume breach”, ""least privilege"", “usability and manageability” and “least functionality”; b) a security-oriented design review to help identify information security vulnerabilities, ensure security controls are specified and meet security requirements; c) documentation and formal acknowledgement of security controls that do not fully meet requirements (e.g. due to overriding safety requirements); d) hardening of systems. The organization should consider ""zero trust"" principles such as: a) assuming the organization’s information systems are already breached and thus not be reliant on network perimeter security alone; b) employing a “never trust and always verify” approach for access to information systems; c) ensuring that requests to information systems are encrypted end-to-end; d) verifying each request to an information system as if it originated from an open, external network, even if these requests originated internal to the organization (i.e. not automatically trusting anything inside or outside its perimeters); e) using ""least privilege"" and dynamic access control techniques (see 5.15, 5.18 and 8.2). This includes authenticating and authorizing requests for information or to systems based on contextual information such as authentication information (see 5.17), user identities (see 5.16), data about the user endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12); f) always authenticating requesters and always validating authorization requests to information systems based on information including authentication information (see 5.17) and user identities (5.16), data about the user endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12), for example enforcing strong authentication (e.g. multi-factor, see 8.5). The established security engineering principles should be applied, where applicable, to outsourced development of information systems through the contracts and other binding agreements between the organization and the supplier to whom the organization outsources. The organization should ensure that suppliers’ security engineering practices align with the organization’s needs. The security engineering principles and the established engineering procedures should be regularly reviewed to ensure that they are effectively contributing to enhanced standards of security within the engineering process. They should also be regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain up-to date in terms of combatting any new potential threats and in remaining applicable to advances in the technologies and solutions being applied.","Secure engineering principles can be applied to the design or configuration of a range of techniques, such as: — fault tolerance and other resilience techniques; — segregation (e.g. through virtualization or containerization); — tamper resistance. Secure virtualization techniques can be used to prevent interference between applications running on the same physical device. If a virtual instance of an application is compromised by an attacker, only that instance is affected. The attack has no effect on any other application or data. Tamper resistance techniques can be used to detect tampering of information containers, whether physical (e.g. a burglar alarm) or logical (e.g. a data file). A characteristic of such techniques is that there is a record of the attempt to tamper with the container. In addition, the control can prevent the successful extraction of data through its destruction (e.g. device memory can be deleted).",Preventive,Protect
A.8.28,8.28,Technological controls,Secure coding,Secure coding principles shall be applied to software development.,To ensure software is written securely thereby reducing the number of potential information security vulnerabilities in the software.,"General The organization should establish organization-wide processes to provide good governance for secure coding. A minimum secure baseline should be established and applied. Additionally, such processes and governance should be extended to cover software components from third parties and open source software. The organization should monitor real world threats and up-to-date advice and information on software vulnerabilities to guide the organization’s secure coding principles through continual improvement and learning. This can help with ensuring effective secure coding practices are implemented to combat the fast-changing threat landscape. Planning and before coding Secure coding principles should be used both for new developments and in reuse scenarios. These principles should be applied to development activities both within the organization and for products and services supplied by the organization to others. Planning and prerequisites before coding should include: a) organization-specific expectations and approved principles for secure coding to be used for both in-house and outsourced code developments; b) common and historical coding practices and defects that lead to information security vulnerabilities; c) configuring development tools, such as integrated development environments (IDE), to help enforce the creation of secure code; d) following guidance issued by the providers of development tools and execution environments as applicable; e) maintenance and use of updated development tools (e.g. compilers); f) qualification of developers in writing secure code; g) secure design and architecture, including threat modelling; h) secure coding standards and where relevant mandating their use; i) use of controlled environments for development. During coding Considerations during coding should include: a) secure coding practices specific to the programming languages and techniques being used; b) using secure programming techniques, such as pair programming, refactoring, peer review, security iterations and test-driven development; c) using structured programming techniques; d) documenting code and removing programming defects, which can allow information security vulnerabilities to be exploited; e) prohibiting the use of insecure design techniques (e.g. the use of hard-coded passwords, unapproved code samples and unauthenticated web services). Testing should be conducted during and after development (see 8.29). Static application security testing (SAST) processes can identify security vulnerabilities in software. Before software is made operational, the following should be evaluated: a) attack surface and the principle of least privilege; b) conducting an analysis of the most common programming errors and documenting that these have been mitigated. Review and maintenance After code has been made operational: a) updates should be securely packaged and deployed; b) reported information security vulnerabilities should be handled (see 8.8); c) errors and suspected attacks should be logged and logs regularly reviewed to make adjustments to the code as necessary; d) source code should be protected against unauthorized access and tampering (e.g. by using configuration management tools, which typically provide features such as access control and version control). If using external tools and libraries, the organization should consider: a) ensuring that external libraries are managed (e.g. by maintaining an inventory of libraries used and their versions) and regularly updated with release cycles; b) selection, authorization and reuse of well-vetted components, particularly authentication and cryptographic components; c) the license, security and history of external components; d) ensuring that software is maintainable, tracked and originates from proven, reputable sources; e) sufficiently long-term availability of development resources and artefacts. Where a software package needs to be modified the following points should be considered: a) the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised; b) whether to obtain the consent of the vendor; c) the possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates; d) the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a result of changes; e) compatibility with other software in use.","A guiding principle is to ensure security-relevant code is invoked when necessary and is tamper resistant. Programs installed from compiled binary code also have these properties but only for data held within the application. For interpreted languages, the concept only works when the code is executed on a server that is otherwise inaccessible by the users and processes that use it, and that its data is held in a similarly protected database. For example, the interpreted code can be run on a cloud service where access to the code itself requires administrator privileges. Such administrator access should be protected by security mechanisms such as just-in-time administration principles and strong authentication. If the application owner can access scripts by direct remote access to the server, so in principle can an attacker. Webservers should be configured to prevent directory browsing in such cases. Application code is best designed on the assumption that it is always subject to attack, through error or malicious action. In addition, critical applications can be designed to be tolerant of internal faults. For example, the output from a complex algorithm can be checked to ensure that it lies within safe bounds before the data is used in an application such as a safety or financial critical application. The code that performs the boundary checks is simple and therefore much easier to prove correctness. Some web applications are susceptible to a variety of vulnerabilities that are introduced by poor design and coding, such as database injection and cross-site scripting attacks. In these attacks, requests can be manipulated to abuse the webserver functionality. More information on ICT security evaluation can be found in the ISO/IEC 15408 series.",Preventive,Protect

Security testing should be an integral part of the testing for systems or components. Security testing should be conducted against a set of requirements, which can be expressed as functional or non-functional. Security testing should include testing of: a) security functions [e.g. user authentication (see 8.5), access restriction (see 8.3) and use of cryptography (see 8.24)]; b) secure coding (see 8.28); c) secure configurations (see 8.9, 8.20 and 8.22) including that of operating systems, firewalls and other security components. Test plans should be determined using a set of criteria. The extent of testing should be in proportion to the importance, nature of the system and the potential impact of the change being introduced. The test plan should include: a) detailed schedule of activities and tests; b) inputs and expected outputs under a range of conditions; c) criteria to evaluate the results; d) decision for further actions as necessary. The organization can leverage automated tools, such as code analysis tools or vulnerability scanners, and should verify the remediation of security related defects. For in-house developments, such tests should initially be performed by the development team. Independent acceptance testing should then be undertaken to ensure that the system works as expected and only as expected (see 5.8). The following should be considered: a) performing code review activities as a relevant element for testing for security flaws, including unanticipated inputs and conditions; b) performing vulnerability scanning to identify insecure configurations and system vulnerabilities; c) performing penetration testing to identify insecure code and design. For outsourced development and purchasing components, an acquisition process should be followed. Contracts with the supplier should address the identified security requirements (see 5.20). Products and services should be evaluated against these criteria before acquisition. Testing should be performed in a test environment that matches the target production environment as closely as possible to ensure that the system does not introduce vulnerabilities to the organization’s environment and that the tests are reliable (see 8.31).","Multiple test environments can be established, which can be used for different kinds of testing (e.g. functional and performance testing). These different environments can be virtual, with individual configurations to simulate a variety of operating environments.

The following points should be considered across the organization’s entire external supply chain: a) licensing agreements, code ownership and intellectual property rights related to the outsourced content (see 5.32); b) contractual requirements for secure design, coding and testing practices (see 8.25 to 8.29); c) provision of the threat model to consider by external developers; d) acceptance testing for the quality and accuracy of the deliverables (see 8.29); e) provision of evidence that minimum acceptable levels of security and privacy capabilities are established (e.g. assurance reports); f) provision of evidence that sufficient testing has been applied to guard against the presence of malicious content (both intentional and unintentional) upon delivery; g) provision of evidence that sufficient testing has been applied to guard against the presence of known vulnerabilities; h) escrow agreements for the software source code (e.g. if the supplier goes out of business); i) contractual right to audit development processes and controls; j) security requirements for the development environment (see 8.31); k) taking consideration of applicable legislation (e.g. on protection of personal data).",Further information on supplier relationships can be found in the ISO/IEC 27036 series.,"Preventive,Detective","Identify,Protect,Detect"
A.8.31,8.31,Technological controls,"Separation of development, test and production environments","Development, testing and production environments shall be separated and secured.",To protect the production environment and data from compromise by development and test activities.,"The level of separation between production, testing and development environments that is necessary to prevent production problems should be identified and implemented. The following items should be considered: a) adequately separating development and production systems and operating them in different domains (e.g. in separate virtual or physical environments); b) defining, documenting and implementing rules and authorization for the deployment of software from development to production status; c) testing changes to production systems and applications in a testing or staging environment prior to being applied to production systems (see 8.29); d) not testing in production environments except in circumstances that have been defined and approved; e) compilers, editors and other development tools or utility programs not being accessible from production systems when not required; f) displaying appropriate environment identification labels in menus to reduce the risk of error; g) not copying sensitive information into the development and testing system environments unless equivalent controls are provided for the development and testing systems. In all cases, development and testing environments should be protected considering: a) patching and updating of all the development, integration and testing tools (including builders, integrators, compilers, configuration systems and libraries); b) secure configuration of systems and software; c) control of access to the environments; d) monitoring of change to the environment and code stored therein; e) secure monitoring of the environments; f) taking backups of the environments. A single person should not have the ability to make changes to both development and production without prior review and approval. This can be achieved for example through segregation of access rights or through rules that are monitored. In exceptional situations, additional measures such as detailed logging and real-time monitoring should be implemented in order to detect and act on unauthorized changes.","Without adequate measures and procedures, developers and testers having access to production systems can introduce significant risks (e.g. unwanted modification of files or system environment, system failure, running unauthorized and untested code in production systems, disclosure of confidential data, data integrity and availability issues). There is a need to maintain a known and stable environment in which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate developer access to the production environment. Measures and procedures include carefully designed roles in conjunction with implementing segregation of duty requirements and having adequate monitoring processes in place. Development and testing personnel also pose a threat to the confidentiality of production information. Development and testing activities can cause unintended changes to software or information if they share the same computing environment. Separating development, testing and production environments is therefore desirable to reduce the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to production software and business data (see 8.33 for the protection of test information). In some cases, the distinction between development, test and production environments can be deliberately blurred and testing can be carried out in a development environment or through controlled rollouts to live users or servers (e.g. small population of pilot users). In some cases, product testing can occur through live use of the product inside the organization. Furthermore, to reduce downtime of live deployments, two identical production environments can be supported where only one is live at any one time. Supporting processes for the use of production data in development and testing environments (8.33) are necessary. Organizations can also consider the guidance provided in this section for training environments when conducting end user training.",Preventive,Protect
A.8.32,8.32,Technological controls,Change management,Changes to information processing facilities and information systems shall be subject to change management procedures.,To preserve information security when executing changes.,"Introduction of new systems and major changes to existing systems should follow agreed rules and a formal process of documentation, specification, testing, quality control and managed implementation. Management responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control of all changes. Change control procedures should be documented and enforced to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in information processing facilities and information systems, for the entire system development life cycle from the early design stages through all subsequent maintenance efforts. Wherever practicable, change control procedures for ICT infrastructure and software should be integrated. The change control procedures should include: a) planning and assessing the potential impact of changes considering all dependencies; b) authorization of changes; c) communicating changes to relevant interested parties; d) tests and acceptance of tests for the changes (see 8.29); e) implementation of changes including deployment plans; f) emergency and contingency considerations including fallback procedures; g) maintaining records of changes that include all of the above; h) ensuring that operating documentation (see 5.37) and user procedures are changed as necessary to remain appropriate; i) ensuring that ICT continuity plans and response and recovery procedures (see 5.30) are changed as necessary to remain appropriate.","Inadequate control of changes to information processing facilities and information systems is a common cause of system or security failures. Changes to the production environment, especially when transferring software from development to operational environment, can impact on the integrity and availability of applications. Changing software can impact the production environment and vice versa. Good practice includes the testing of ICT components in an environment segregated from both the production and development environments (see 8.31). This provides a means of having control over new software and allowing additional protection of operational information that is used for testing purposes. This should include patches, service packs and other updates. Production environment includes operating systems, databases and middleware platforms. The control should be applied for changes of applications and infrastructures.",Preventive,Protect
A.8.33,8.33,Technological controls,Test information,"Test information shall be appropriately selected, protected and managed.",To ensure relevance of testing and protection of operational information used for testing.,"Test information should be selected to ensure the reliability of tests results and the confidentiality of the relevant operational information. Sensitive information (including personally identifiable information) should not be copied into the development and testing environments (see 8.31). The following guidelines should be applied to protect the copies of operational information, when used for testing purposes, whether the test environment is built in-house or on a cloud service: a) applying the same access control procedures to test environments as those applied to operational environments; b) having a separate authorization each time operational information is copied to a test environment; c) logging the copying and use of operational information to provide an audit trail; d) protecting sensitive information by removal or masking (see 8.11) if used for testing; e) properly deleting (see 8.10) operational information from a test environment immediately after the testing is complete to prevent unauthorized use of test information. Test information should be securely stored (to prevent tampering, which can otherwise lead to invalid results) and only used for testing purposes.",System and acceptance testing can require substantial volumes of test information that are as close as possible to operational information.,Preventive,Protect

If read-only access is not available to obtain the necessary information, executing the test by an experienced administrator who has the necessary access rights on behalf of the auditor; d) if access is granted, establishing and verifying the security requirements (e.g. antivirus and patching) of the devices used for accessing the systems (e.g. laptops or tablets) before allowing the access; e) only allowing access other than read-only for isolated copies of system files, deleting them when the audit is completed, or giving them appropriate protection if there is an obligation to keep such files under audit documentation requirements; f) identifying and agreeing on requests for special or additional processing, such as running audit tools; g) running audit tests that can affect system availability outside business hours; h) monitoring and logging all access for audit and test purposes.","Audit tests and other assurance activities can also happen on development and test systems, where such tests can impact for example the integrity of code or lead to disclosure of any sensitive information held in such environments.",Preventive,Protect
