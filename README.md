### Junction Tables

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

- **Visit the ATT&CK Sync website.** Access changelogs that detail the cumulative
  changes between any ATT&CK versions. This is especially helpful if your organization
  is contemplating an upgrade of internal systems to a more recent version of ATT&CK.
- **Review the sample documents.** These documents will give you a better idea of how
  ATT&CK Sync can your organization major time and effort while staying in sync with
  ATT&CK.
- **Tell us what you think.** As the project grows, we want to cover a broader set of
  use cases. Let us know if you like this idea and how we can make it even better in
  future releases.
