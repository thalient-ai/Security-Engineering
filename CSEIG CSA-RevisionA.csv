CSA ID,Title,Pillar,Description,Testability
CSA-01,Control Access,Prevent,"System shall only allow identified, authenticated, and authorized persons and non-person entities (including all assigned cyber defenders and their tools) access or interconnection to system or sub-system elements. The capability shall enforce a validation mechanism to protect the C, I, A [confidentiality, integrity, and availability] of system resources (e.g., memory, files, interfaces, logical networks). The system shall employ anti-tamper measures that include features for protection of critical system components, information technologies, and maintenance of technology / program protection. Physical access to the system shall also be controlled.","Attributes that must be defined include: WHO may access the system, under WHAT conditions, from WHERE, and HOW that access can be made. For example, a high-criticality system may have limits on WHO may access it (such as only specific operators or defenders with specific clearances and read-ins) and management of the system may also be subject to controls (such as for specific tasks), WHERE authorized people may access (such as specific administrative consoles in restricted areas) and the HOW may be also constrained (e.g., password strength, Common Access Card (CAC), token, two-person control, mandatory record keeping, cyber defender entry port). An example of a high-criticality program with these types of limits might be the Navy’s Aegis Weapons System, and a low-criticality program might be the Defense Travel System."
CSA-02,Reduce System’s Cyber Detectability,Prevent,"System survivability requires that signaling and communications (both wired and wireless) implemented by the system (or state “supported by system/capability”) shall minimize the ability an adversary to monitor and/or target system and/or supported DoD weapon systems through its emanations, which may include deception.","Attributes that must be defined include: the media in which detectability should be limited, the maximum distance/signal strength, and non-operational signature items (e.g., waste heat, sidelobe radiation, IP mapping)."
CSA-03,Secure Transmissions and Communications,Prevent,System shall ensure all transmissions and communications of data ‘in transit’ are protected commensurate with its confidentiality and integrity requirements. System shall only use NSA certified cryptographic capabilities.,"Attributes that must be considered include: the level of NSA-approved encryption required, including hash strength, encryption type, waveform verification methods, wireless communications techniques, checksums, etc. Derived attributes shall comply with current DoD Cryptographic Modernization (Crypto Mod) standards. Consult the Annotated References section of this guide for current cybersecurity/cyber cryptographic modernization policy references."
CSA-04,Protect System’s Information from Exploitation,Prevent,"System shall ensure all data ‘at rest’ is protected commensurate with its confidentiality and integrity requirements. System shall prevent unauthorized access, use, modification, and transfer/removal of data, including attempted exfiltration, from the system to unauthorized person and non-person entities throughout the system’s lifecycle (including development).","Attributes that must be defined include: requirement for encryption of data at rest, limits on system privileges, password strength requirements, use of tokens, conformance with patches and Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)."
CSA-05,Partition and Ensure Critical Functions at Mission Completion Performance Levels,Prevent,System partitioning shall implement technical / logical mitigations including logical and physical segmentation. The system shall be able to maintain mission critical functions at minimum performance thresholds identified within the system’s CONOPS. Compromise of non-critical functions shall not significantly impact system mission capability.,"Attributes that must be defined include: degree of partitioning, segmentation and diversity (physical and logical), permissibility of cloud use for system or data, availability of war reserve modes, protection of media and removable storage. As an example to measure mission performance and related success, availability with respect to mission and systems can be used as a function of up-time and down-time."
CSA-06,Minimize and Harden Attack Surfaces,Prevent,"System shall automatically disable all unauthorized ports, protocols, and services (PPS), including access points, by default. Any deviations from PPS baselines shall be approved and documented by a configuration management board. System shall support automated monitoring and logging of system attack surface and associated cyber-events. Any removable media use must be approved, documented and strictly monitored.","Attributes that must be defined include limits on open ports, portable media, exposure outside the assigned enclave, trusted connections for maintenance/logistics, etc."
CSA-07,Baseline & Monitor Systems and Detect Anomalies,Mitigate,"System shall implement and maintain a cyber survivability configuration baseline for its GOTS/COTS HW, SW, FW and open source modules, by version number to ensure an operationally acceptable cyber risk posture 24/7 (note: drives CDRLs). System shall monitor, detect and report system health status and anomalies indicative of cyber events, based on its current adversary cyber threat intelligence, CONOPS, and Mission Relevant Terrain in Cyberspace (MRT-C). Applicable report detail shall be provided to users, system operators and assigned cyber defenders (e.g., system shall report anomalies such as configuration changes, cyber-event indicators, slowed processing or loss of functionality within T = (# of seconds/minutes) [specified by sponsor].",Attributes that must be defined include: types of anomalies expected to be detected and the speed/time of detection; the means of detection and reporting (to drive CDRLs); standard for automation of these tasks; data types and information flows for elevation to assigned cyber defenders.
CSA-08,Manage System Performance and Enable Cyberspace Defense,Mitigate,"If anomalies are detected and/or cyber-events degrade system capability, the system shall be sufficiently resilient to mitigate cyber-related event effects through orderly, structured and prioritized system responses, in order to ensure minimum mission functionality requirements [system functionality threshold specified by sponsor] to complete the current mission or return for recovery. The system shall enable assigned cyber defenders to impose effects on adversaries to counter their operations and objectives. Alternatively, the mission commander shall be able to selectively disconnect/disable subsystems that are not critical as well as isolate the system from integrated platform systems and/or the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN).","Attributes that must be defined include: prioritization of functions to be preserved, minimum functionality, alternate capabilities to ensure minimum functionality, time to restore minimum functionality to complete the mission."
CSA-09,Recover System Capabilities,Recover,"After a cyber-event, the system shall be capable of being restored to a known good configuration from a trusted source; at a minimum, restored to partial mission capability, between mission cycles or within xx hours [specified by sponsor], to fight another day. System recovery shall prioritize cyber operational resiliency functions [specified by sponsor].","Attributes that must be defined include: speed of recovery, prioritization of functions to be recovered first, quality/quantity of data/functionality required, updates to prevent newly identified risks, and capability to replace or reconfigure capabilities to mitigate new threat vectors. The time to restore mission is the minimum level of acceptable risk that a mission can afford, also directly related to down-time in the availability mission performance measure. Another metric to inform mission capability analysis is the duration (or up-time) a mission needs to perform its desired function."
CSA-10,Actively Manage System’s Configurations to Achieve and Maintain an Operationally-relevant Cyber Risk Posture,Adapt,"Throughout a system’s lifecycle and within one standard mission cycle of xx hours [specified by sponsor] of identification of a drop in cyber risk posture below its commensurate CSRC level, the system shall have a configuration management process, supported by automated capabilities and technology refresh options, to achieve and continuously maintain an objectively assessed and operationally-relevant risk posture. The process shall include inputs from operators, defenders and intel analysts to continuously assess changes in adversary threat, and include a machine readable Bill of Materials (BOM) of the system’s GOTS/COTS HW, SW, FW and open source modules for a supply chain risk assessment prior to each milestone decision and supported release. The process shall determine the sufficiency of system cyber survivability and support a DevOps framework to prioritize vulnerability mitigation and remediation in the system and connected infrastructure with greatest mission risks. (note: drives CDRLs)","Attributes that must be defined include: how patches are authenticated, how quickly they must be applied, how they are verified once installed, the tolerance for types and quantities and delay, during development and throughout the system’s lifecycle."
